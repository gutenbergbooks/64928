</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Those</span>
students of arms and armour who have Mr. Clephan’s work on
<i>Defensive Armour, Weapons and Engines of War</i> in their libraries
will expect to find valuable material for study when they find his name
as author of a work on the Tournament. And in this they will surely
not be disappointed. It is perhaps a novel experience for one who has
for some years seriously meditated such a work himself to be asked to
introduce the work of another; but in the study of arms and armour all
men are brothers, and I take leave to say that we of this brotherhood
know little of the jealousies and divisions of opinion which beset the
student in other historical details. The perusal of Mr. Clephan’s work
has shown me that it would have been impossible to undertake such a
project without unattainable leisure, tireless energy, deep research
and very real devotion to the subject. Mr. Clephan has dealt with the
subject from a wide European point of view, and has amassed a vast
amount of information from German sources which has, up till now, been
denied to those unskilled in that language; and, with his copious notes
and references, has made this material available for study, for which
alone we must ever be deeply indebted to him.</p>

<p>The Tournament, as practised in Germany and towards the close of
the sixteenth century in England, France and Italy, must have been a
rather dull performance, as the minute regulations and the cumbersome
equipment precluded that dash and intrepid onslaught which make the
descriptions by Froissart and other writers of his time such excellent
reading. Even the gorgeous displays of Henry VIII leave us rather cold
when we find that the king invariably won, and that the queen could
stop the tilting at her pleasure, which was presumably when her lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
had had sufficient entertainment. We have only to note that the suit in
the Tower made for Henry VIII to fight on foot in the lists weighs 93
lbs., to realize that no man could be strenuous or energetic in this
equipment; and when we find that the horse in the sixteenth century
joust had to carry a dead weight of 340 lbs., it will be manifest that
he could only amble gently along the tilt, and could not dash headlong
down the lists, as the artist would have us believe. The whole subject
of arms and armour teems with such disillusioning; but to the earnest
student these are taken with grace, because they are born of facts
quarried out of masses of written and printed records with years of
incessant perseverance and devotion.</p>

<p>After the pioneer work of Meyrick and Hewitt, the interest in arms
and armour died down for over half a century, but in the last ten or
fifteen years it has revived, and its resurrection may be traced to
writers who, like Lord Dillon and Mr. Clephan, have striven to give
us a real insight into the military life of nations, rather than
highly-coloured fantasies which have no foundation in fact. If Mr.
Clephan’s researches cause us to modify our views on certain aspects
of the Tournament, I feel quite certain that all who have previously
written on these lines will admit the new light he has brought to bear.
The audience he directly appeals to is small, but they will yield to
students in no other branch of history or art in their keen devotion to
their subject; and I trust I may conclude, in their name, by wishing
Mr. Clephan every success in the work before us, and, if I may enter
into the spirit of his subject, “Good jousting.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Most</span>
of us owe our early impressions of the tournament to the
delightful account of the “Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms” of Ashby
de la Zouche, in the county of Leicester, given by Sir Walter Scott in
his fine romance <i>Ivanhoe</i>. But that eminent novelist, in presenting
to his readers the picture of a <i>pas d’armes</i> of the times of the
lion-hearted Richard, took a poet’s licence by describing a jousting
and <i>mêlée</i> such as belonged, in many details, to a time later than
Richard’s by some two and a half centuries. The knightly armour of the
reign of King Richard was of chain-mail, while that of the times of
Henry VI was, of course, a complete harness of plate. The first-named
equipment is thus described by Sainte-Palaye: “<i>Une lance forte et
dificile à rompre, un haubert ou haubergeon, c’est à dire, une double
cotte de mailles, tissues de fer, à l’epreuve de l’épée, étoient les
armes assignées aux Chevaliers.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Sir Walter’s account is thus hopelessly misleading in regard to its
period, though admirably worked out in many other respects. There are
ancient romances of great historic value, in that they give nearly
contemporaneous details of the tournament of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, and represent many features which may be regarded
as correct in the light of a close comparison with other records. That
of <i>Petit Jehan de Saintré</i>, written by Anthoine de la Sale, in 1459,
is one of these, and we owe much enlightenment to it.</p>

<p>There is great confusion among the works of chroniclers in regard to
the dates of many tournaments, and often it is impossible to reconcile
their statements. The differences are, however, usually but slight.</p>

<p>Mr. ffoulkes, in his Preface to this work, draws attention to the large
amount of fable and exaggeration so often interwoven in many accounts
given of the tournament, and to the necessity for presenting the
subject historically in its true light. In order to do this one must
discard much that has been written concerning it throughout the ages and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
go back to original information, carefully sifted and compared, in
order to arrive at some degree of truth.</p>

<p>As a rule, illuminations in MSS. must not be estimated at their
face value, for, besides being often fantastic, they are rarely
contemporaneous with the events they portray; and the narrations of
chroniclers were mostly written some time after the events in question,
and often introduce details which really belong to a later age. Thus
the illustrated <i>Froissart</i> in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which dates from about the end of the fifteenth century, pictures
a joust at the tilt at the <i>pas d’armes</i> held at St. Inglevert in
the year 1389, a tournament described in our <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">chapter IV</a>;
but a tilt or barrier placed between the combatants, along which they rode in
opposite directions, was first employed about the end of the first
quarter of the century following. Such anachronisms are very common in
records of the tournament, so that care and discrimination are required
in their interpretation.</p>

<p>The works of Meyrick and Hewitt are of great historical value, and they
afford much information carefully gathered from original documents.
This information has been copiously made use of by more recent authors
with but a scant or even no acknowledgment. It should be remembered,
however, that these eminent and devoted historians were pioneers, so
to speak, and much has been learnt of the tournament since their day;
yet their labours form excellent foundations for the building up of a
scientific superstructure.</p>

<p>The admirable version of <i>Freydal</i>, by Querin von Leitner, pictures
the jousts of the Emperor Maximilian I, especially those of the last
quarter of the fifteenth century. It presents a veritable mine of
information concerning the tournament of that period, placing the
technique of the subject on a sound basis. Even this account, however,
is hardly contemporaneous.</p>

<p>The interest in the subject flagged for a season, and until some
quarter of a century ago but little more was heard of it. It was
Wendelin Boeheim, in his <i>Waffenkunde</i>, who set the ball rolling again;
and since his book was written a number of learned papers have appeared
in England and Germany dealing with the tournament, though in French
literature the subject has received but little attention. Among such
papers those by Viscount Dillon, published in <i>Archæologia</i> and
the <i>Archæological Journal</i>, are very important. This writer has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
corrected many mistakes made by the earlier authors and persistently
handed down from one generation to another. Most of the writers
would appear to have regarded as gospel truths all statements made
by Meyrick. These mistakes are most difficult to eradicate from our
literature, for their correction has been made in publications such as
those mentioned above, which are unfortunately only read by a select few.</p>

<p>All these learned books and scattered papers treat the subject more or
less sectionally, and, so far as I know, there has been no work of any
importance published which attempts to deal with the subject as a whole
from start to finish. This manifest want I have endeavoured to supply
in the present volume.</p>

<p>My position for many years, up to the date of the war, as an official
of the Verein für Historische Waffenkunde, gave me access to a mass of
original information concerning what may be fitly termed the German
period. Such information is not readily got at, and much of it has
been embodied in the present volume. It is to such sources that we
must turn for many details, more particularly for those of a technical
nature. These records, however, mainly relate to tournaments of the
last quarter of the fifteenth century (after the Burgundian Chronicles
cease), to the whole of the sixteenth, and so up to the time when the
institution fell into desuetude.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Mr. Basil Anderton, <span class="smcap">m.a.</span>,
the Public Librarian of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for reading over parts of my MS.
and for drawing attention to many books bearing on the subject
of the tournament; to Mr. Charles J. ffoulkes, <span class="smcap">B.Litt.</span>,
<span class="smcap">f.s.a.</span>, Curator of the Armouries of the Tower of London; to
Mr. Frederick Walter Dendy, <span class="smcap">d.c.l.</span>, and Mr. Samuel T. Meynell,
for some valuable suggestions; and to the University of Cambridge for
the loan of books.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible
to trace the beginnings of these martial exercises, mention of which
first appears in history in chronicles of the eleventh century; but
they doubtless grew out of earlier forms of the rough games and sports
engaged in by the noble youth of the period as practice for actual warfare.</p>

<p>Du Cange in his <i>Glossarium</i>, under the heading “Torneamentum,” cites
Roger de Hoveden, who defines tournaments as being military exercises
carried out in a spirit of comradeship, being practice for war and a
display of personal prowess.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Their chief distinction from other exercises of a kindred nature lies
in the fact that they were actual contests on horseback, carried out
within certain limitations, of many cavaliers who divided themselves
into contending troops or parties, which fought against each other like
opposing armies.</p>

<p>Mention of rules for observance in the conducting of these martial
games is made by more than one chronicler of the period as having been
framed in the year 1066, by a French Seigneur, Geoffroi de Preuilli of
Anjou, and it is stated that he had invented them and even been killed
in one of them;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and the very names “<i>tourneamentum</i>” and “<i>tournoi</i>” would imply a
French origin. These designations would seem to have been derived from
“<i>tournier</i>,” to wheel round; though Claude Fauchet, writing in the
last quarter of the sixteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
expresses the opinion that the word “<i>tournoi</i>” came about from the
cavaliers running par tour, that is by turns at the quintain: “<i>fut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
premièrement appellé Tournoy pource que les Cheualiers ŷ coururent
par tour; rompans premièrement leur bois et lances contre vne Quintaine....</i>”</p>

<p>Military games of a similar nature are often stated to have been
practised in Germany earlier than this, and Favine in <i>Theatre of
Honour and Knighthood</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
prints a list of rules and ordinances for observance at a “tournament”
to be held at Magdeburg, as having been issued by the Emperor of
Germany Henry I, surnamed the Fowler, 876-936, a century and a half
earlier than the date of the promulgation of the rules of Pruilli. The
German text, however, bears the impress of a later period than early in
the tenth century, and this view is expressed by Claude Fauchet, who
gives the rules, which are curious enough for insertion here; and he
mentions the authority from which Favine drew his statement.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Jousts and Tournaments were classed under the heading of <i>Hastiludia</i>
or spear-play: as also was the behourd or buhurt, <i>Bohordicum</i> in
Mediæval Latin,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
a military exercise of a similar nature; though in what respect
it differed from the joust or tournament is nowhere stated. That
it was an exercise with lance and shield is clearly shown in a passage
in <i>Concilium Albiense</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
That the behourd was practised continuously for long after the
introduction of the joust and tournament is known by the fact of the
issue of royal edicts for the prohibition of these exercises, as late
as the reign of King Edward I.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The origin of the joust does not appear to be less ancient than that of
the tourney itself,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
which it gradually almost supplanted; and it may have been suggested
by the quintain. William of Malmesbury thus defines it:—Justa, jouste.
<i>Monomachia ludicra, hastiludium singulare.</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The Bayeux tapestry shows a kind of combat with spears.</p>

<p>The terms “tourney” and “joust” are often confounded with each other,
but they are sharply different, the former being a battle in miniature,
an armed contest of courtesy on horseback, troop against troop; while
the other is a single combat of mounted cavaliers, run with lances
in the lists; though jousting was by no means confined to these
enclosures; indeed, such contests were sometimes run in the open street
or square of a town. Jousts were often included with the tourney,
though frequently held independently; and as the lance was the weapon
of the former so was the sword greatly that of the latter. The lance
was to be directed at the body only, otherwise it was considered foul
play. The joust more especially was run in honour of ladies. These
martial games were much practised in all the countries of chivalry.</p>

<p>The chroniclers are vague in their definitions of the Round Table
game, the <i>Tabula Rotunda</i>, or as Matthew Paris calls it “<i>Mensa
Rotunda</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
He expressly distinguishes it from the tournament, though in what
respect it differs from it he does not enlighten us. He describes a
<i>tabula rotunda</i>, held at the Abbey of Wallenden in the year 1252,
which was attended by a great number of cavaliers, both English and
foreign, and states that on the fourth day of the meeting a knight
named Arnold de Montigney was pierced in the throat by a lance “<i>which
had not been blunted as it ought to have been</i>.” The lance-head
remained in the wound and death soon followed. We see from this
incident that already in the middle of the thirteenth century it was
customary to joust with blunted or rebated lances! In 1279 (8 Ed. I) a
Round Table was held by Roger Earl of Mortimer, at his castle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Kenilworth, which is thus described in <i>Historia Prioratus de
Wigmore</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>:—“He
(Mortimer) invited a hundred knights and as many ladies to an hastilude
at Kenilworth, which he celebrated for three days at a vast expense.
Then he began the round table; and the golden lion, the prize for the
triumphant knight, was awarded to him.” Dugdale states that the reason
for the institution itself was to assert the principle of equality and
to avoid questions of precedence among the knights.</p>

<p>In some “Observations on the Institution of the Most Noble Order of
the Garter,” printed in <i>Archæologia</i> of the year 1846,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
it is stated that in 1343, King Edward III in imitation of King Arthur,
the traditional founder of British Chivalry, bent on reviving the fabled
glories of a by-gone age, determined to hold a Round Table at Windsor
on the 19th of January, 1344. The intended meeting was proclaimed
by heralds of the king, in France, Scotland, Burgundy, Hainault,
Flanders, Brabant, and in the German Empire, offering safe-conducts to
all foreign knights and esquires wishful to take part in it.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
King Edward fixed the number of the tenans at forty, enrolling the bravest
in the land; and he appointed that a “Feast” should be kept from year
to year at Windsor on every following St. George’s Day. Walsingham,
writing about half a century after Froissart, states that in 1344 the
King began to build a house in Windsor Park, which should be called the
“Round Table”; that it was circular in form, and 200 feet in diameter.
It is also stated that a circular table, made of wood, was constructed
at Windsor sometime before 1356; and that the Prior of Merton was
paid L26-13-4 for 52 oaks, taken from his woods near Reading, for the
material.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Walsingham relates that Philip of France, jealous of the fame of our
king, had a table made on the Windsor model.</p>

<p>Matthew of Westminster chronicles that a round table was held in 1352,
which had a fatal ending.</p>

<p>There is an actual round table of ancient provenance hanging on the
eastern wall of the hall of the royal palace at Winchester, the reputed
“painted table of Arthur,” and there are some remarks concerning it in
the Winchester volume of the Archæological Institute, 1846, telling all
that is known concerning it. The hall itself may have been standing in
the reign of Henry III; and in the sixteenth century, and probably long
before, a round table was an appendage to it; but as to the approximate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
date of its make there is no reliable evidence. The earliest historic
reference to the table is by Hardyng, late in the reign of Henry VI
or early in that of Edward IV, who alludes to it as “hanging yet” at
Winchester; and Paulus Jovius tells us that the table was shown to
the emperor Charles V in 1520, when it had been newly painted for the
“last” time, but that the marginal names had been restored unskilfully.
In the reign of Henry VIII a sum of <i>L66-16-11</i> was expended in
repairing the “<i>aula regis infra castrum de Wynchestre, et le Round
tabyll ibidem</i>.” John Lesley, bishop of Ross, said that he saw the
table not long before 1578, and that the names of the knights were
inscribed on its circumference; and a Spanish writer, who was present
at the marriage of Philip and Mary, thus describes the painting on the
table:—</p>

<p lang="fr" class="blockquot">“<i>Lors du mariage de Philip II. avec la
reine Marie, on montrait encore à Hunscrit la table ronde fabriquée
par Merlin: elle se composait de 25 compartemens teintés en blank et
en vert, lesquels se terminaient en pointe au milieu, et allaient
s’elargissant jusqu’à la circonférence, et dans chaque division étaient
écrits le nom du cavalier et celui du roi. L’un de ces compartemens
appelé place de Judas, ou siége périlleux, restait toujours vide.</i>”</p>

<p>The forms of the lettering and general decoration of the table point to
a date in the reign of Henry VII or early in that of Henry VIII, but
this, of course, only applies to the painted enrichment. Whatever may
be the date of this table and its painting, they are both undoubtedly
of considerable antiquity, probably from five to six centuries old.</p>

<p>The <i>fête d’armes</i> held by Boucicaut at St. Ingelbert in 1389 (which
is described in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>), is called in the account
of the meeting a “table-ronde”; and the text would imply that the holding of a round
table meant a <i>hastilude</i> at which the challengers or tenans kept open
house to all comers, as well as meeting them in combat in the lists;
and the institution is thus coupled with the banquet. The passage
runs:—</p>

<p lang="fr" class="blockquot">“<i>Ainsi feit là son appareil moult
grandement et très-honnorablement messire Boucicaut, et feit
faire provisions de très-bon vins, et de tous vivres largement,
et à plain, et de tout ce qu’il convient si plantureusement
comme ‘pour tenir table rond à tout venans’ tout le dict
temps durant, et tout aux propres despens de Boucicaut.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
The same lavish hospitality was extended here as at Kenilworth in 1279,
Windsor in 1344.</p>

<p>It is clear from various records that the tenans at a round table of
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries sometimes fought under the
names of King Arthur’s knights, indeed, “Sir Galehos” appears among the
names of the knights inscribed on the actual round table at Winchester;
and they also sometimes adopted the names of other legendary heroes,
for at a round table held at Valenciennes in 1344, at which the prize
was a peacock, victory was achieved by a band of cavaliers which fought
under the names of King Alexander’s knights.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The accounts given of King Edward’s tournament at Windsor, and that of
the later Boucicaut’s <i>pas d’armes</i>, both of which are called round
tables, may be said to define sufficiently what a “Round Table” of
the fourteenth century really was; and we fail to find any material
difference from other meetings of the kind and period.</p>

<p>Favine in <i>Theatre of Honour and Knighthood</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
refers to “<i>Hastiludia Rotunda</i>” as being practice for cavaliers “to
sit well their horses, to keepe themselues fast in their saddles
and stirups. For, if any man fell, and his Horse upon him, at these
encounterings with their lances, lightly worse did befall him before
he could any way get forth of the Preasse. But others came to heauior
fortune, their liues expyring in the place, being trod and trampled
on by others”—but all this would apply to the ordinary <i>mêlée</i>. This
form of tourney was much in favour during the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, but we hear no more of round tables after that.</p>

<p>The Quintain (<i>quintana</i>) and Running at the Ring (<i>Ringelrennen</i>,
<i>Corso all’ Annello</i>) were closely allied with the joust, and were
practised in preparation for it; the chief objects for attainment in
the former being a correct aim, to remain steady in the saddle after
impact with the figure, and deftly to get rid of the stump of the
broken lance. The quintain was a more ancient game than the joust, and
indeed, not improbably, it gave rise to it; and being free from the
risk of personal danger, was a sport and pastime of the people. The
game assumed many forms, though it was chiefly a means of practice
with the lance, sword, baston and battle-axe, indulged in by the young
aspirants for knighthood as well as by the citizens and yeomanry. The
original quintain was merely a post set up, against which the strokes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
were directed or against a shield hanging from it, with the same
object in view. Later, the post developed into a human figure, usually
fashioned as a Turk or Saracen, who held a wooden sword in his hand.
The objective of the lance was the space between the eyes; and the
figure was placed on a pivot, and so constructed that a misdirected
stroke, that is a hit too much on one side or the other, would cause
it to spin round with great velocity, dealing the tyro a smart blow
with the sword. Another form was a bag of sand, from which the clumsy
operator was apt to receive a buffet as it swung round or to have the
contents expended over his horse and person; and there were other
similar varieties of the game. The water quintain was practised from
a boat, rapidly propelled by rowers; while the player stood at the
bow, his lance couched and directed towards a shield, hung from a post
standing in the water. The quintain continued to be a popular game
right through the seventeenth century, and could be played on foot as
well as on horseback. A picture of a quintain is given on a miniature
in the <i>Chroniques de Charlemagne</i>, in the Burgundian Library at
Brussels, and is reproduced by Lacroix in <i>Military and Religious Life
in the Middle Ages and Renaissance</i>.</p>

<p>Running or Tilting at the Ring was merely a later form of the quintain.
An upright shaft or post was holed at intervals for the reception
of a rounded bar, socketed into it at right-angles, from which hung
the ring placed on a level with the player’s eye; and the horseman,
couching his lance, rode towards it at full gallop with the object
of transfixing it. When fairly hit the ring became detached by the
action of side springs and remained on the head of the lance. Pluvinal
gives particulars of the game as practised at the beginning of the
seventeenth century; it was much in vogue at the court of Louis XIV.
For running at the ring the lance was much shorter than that employed
in jousting, its length was 10 ft. 7 in. and weight 7 lbs. There is
a specimen at Dresden, tipped with a cone to hold the ring when hit,
and there is naturally no vamplate. It will be realised what excellent
practice these sports afforded for the joust and tourney. Both games
are described in Strutt’s <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>. MS., Ashmole 837, fol.
185, furnishes an instance of the game:—</p>

<p>Judicial Combats are also properly classed under the general heading
of the Tournament, and these duels, on foot and on horseback, were
fought greatly subject to its rules and regulations. An account of this
singular institution follows after the tournament proper.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Jousts</span>
of Peace, <i>Hastiludia pacifica</i>, were those of sport, military
exercises and courtesy; while Jousts of War, <i>Joûtes à Outrance</i>, or
as Froissart calls them “<i>Justes Mortelles et à Champ</i>,” were combats
to the death, though subjected to the intervention of the umpire at
any stage, by the casting of his bâton, by which a serious wounding or
death was often prevented. The term “<i>à outrance</i>,” however, was used
not infrequently in <i>Chapitres d’Armes</i> or articles of combat where no
fatal ending was in contemplation; they were encounters of courtesy in
fact, though contests in which battle-axes, sharp swords and pointed
lances were employed.</p>

<p>The chroniclers of the joust and tournament of the earlier centuries
exhibit a lack of technical knowledge, and the terms they employ are
often mixed and conflicting; and, indeed, this confusion continues
throughout later centuries also, to an extent making any exact
definition of terms extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Whatever information we possess regarding tournaments of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries is greatly derived from the Mediæval Latin
chronicles of the Anglo-Norman monks; but the material they furnish
requires to be used with discretion, owing to the frequent unhappy
blending of fact and legend, a lack of professional knowledge, and a
way of reporting things of half a century or more ago in harmony with
the environment of the time of writing. Among the chroniclers of the
tournament of the period we are immediately dealing with, are William
of Malmesbury, whose <i>History of the Kings of England</i> finishes at
the year 1142; Wace, who wrote the <i>Roman de Rou</i>, on Rollo and the
succeeding Dukes of Normandy, in 1160; William of Newbury, 1197; Roger
of Hoveden, 1201.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
William Fitzstephen was an eye-witness of the events he relates; the
prolific and illuminating Matthew Paris, 1259; Robert of Gloucester,
who died in 1290; and Matthew of Westminster, 1307.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Much information concerning the body-armour of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries has been derived from seals, and particularly from
those of the kings of England; also from illuminations in chronicles,
representations on tapestry and carvings in ivory. Military effigies
and brasses have also proved of immense value, for they enable us to
fill in many of the gaps left in the recitals of chroniclers, and
afford precise information as to the knightly equipment for battle,
as far as least as the presence of the surcoat will permit. We have,
indeed, been favoured among the nations in the preservation of so many
of these monuments. There are but few brasses of the thirteenth century
existing, though effigies are very numerous. Sad it is that so many of
these priceless memorials have been lost or thoughtlessly mutilated;
but their very important bearing upon history was but faintly
recognised much before the nineteenth century began. Many of them had
been thrown on the rubbish heap to make way for some trivial and often
mischievous alteration, or lost when some of our finest churches were
spoilt by what is so often miscalled restoration; and many even of the
effigies left to us have been exposed to a process of tinkering by
thoughtless hands. Not a detail is missing on many of those monuments
that remain, and even colours are indicated.</p>

<p>William of Newbury states that tournaments first appear in England
in the troubled reign of King Stephen, 1135-1154; and that they
were introduced from France by the Norman nobles is clear from
the expressions employed by Matthew Paris concerning them, viz.:
“Conflictus Gallicus” and “batailles francaises.” Lombarde<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
states that “the kings of this realm before King Stephen, would not suffer
it to be frequented within their land; so that, such as for exercise
in that feate in armes, were driven to passe over the seas, and to
performe in some different place in a foreigne countrie: but afterwards
King Stephen in his time allowed it.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
It was the Norman knights who introduced the employment and couching of
the lance in England. Of that age we have the remarkable description
of the martial sports of London by William Fitzstephen. He tells us
‘that every Sunday in Lent, immediately after dinner it was customary
for great crowds of Londoners, mounted on war-horses, well trained to
perform the necessary turnings and evolutions, to ride into the fields
in distinct bands, armed “<i>hastilibus ferro dempto</i>,” with shields and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
headless lances; where they exhibited representations of battle, and
went through a variety of warlike exercises: at the same time many of
the young noblemen who had not received the honour of knighthood, came
from the King’s court, and from the houses of the great barons, to make
a trial of their skill in arms; the hope of victory animating their
minds. The youth being divided into opposite companies, encountered
one another; in one place they fled, and others pursued, without being
able to overtake them; in another place one of the bands overtook and
over-turned the other.’</p>

<p>Robert of Gloucester, in his <i>Chronicle</i> in verse, which ends shortly
before the accession of King Edward I, writes concerning William Rufus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Stalwarde he was ＆ hardy ＆ god knyght, thorn al thyng</span>
<span class="i0">In batayle ＆ in ‘tornemnes’ er than he were Kyng.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">but this of course has not the value of contemporary history.</p>

<p>The knight-errant of the twelfth century and even later often spent
the evening of his days as an anchorite, undergoing many self-imposed
penances, fastings and flagellations in expiation of many acts of
violence and even oppression of his active career.</p>

<p>The tournaments of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were
characterized by all the romantic fire of knight-errantry, though they
were often rough and disorderly, and not infrequently degenerated
into real battles or free fights, in which many of the combatants
were seriously injured or killed. At the meeting held at Neuss, near
Cologne, in 1240, sixty of the combatants are stated to have been
killed. In England an Earl of Salisbury died from his hurts; his
grandson, Sir William Montague, was killed when jousting with his own
father; and many prominent knights and nobles were so injured in the
tourney that they never regained their health. Tournaments generally
tended to become milder as rules, regulations and limitations were
enacted for their government; but it was not before the reign of King
Edward I that they were brought under any regular disciplined system
of control.</p>

<p>After the reign of King Stephen these martial exercises often came
under the ban of both church and state, the former even going to the
length of excommunication and the refusal of Christian burial to the
fallen. Pope Gregory issued a bull against them in 1228, and there
were other bulls.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
King Henry II discouraged them and issued edicts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
against them; and we are told by William of Newbury that many young
cavaliers travelled from England to enjoy their favourite pastime in
other lands, especially France. Tournaments were revived in England,
says Jocelin of Brakelond,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
after the return of the heroic Richard from the Holy Land, who granted
licences for holding them; and from this time forward unlicensed
tourneying was treated as an offence against the crown. Roger de
Hoveden writes in <i>Annals</i>, under the year 1194 (in translation):—“King
Richard ordered tournaments to be held in England, which he confirmed
by charter; but that all wishing to tourney should pay for the
privilege according to rank—viz., an earl, 20 marks of silver; a baron,
10 marks; a knight, holding land, 4 marks; and any who were landless,
2 marks; and no knight was permitted to enter any lists without first
having paid his fee.” The charter of this grant was delivered into the
custody of William, Earl of Salisbury; and Hubert Fitz-Walter, the
king’s chief-justice, appointed his brother, Theobald Fitz-Walter, to
be collector.</p>

</div>

<p>Tournaments became controlled by royal ordinances, and any infraction
of the rules laid down was punishable with the forfeiture of horse
and armour, imprisonment and other penalties; though at times the
regulations would seem to have been very loosely interpreted or
entirely disregarded. This assumption of control by the state had
been brought about by various causes quite apart from the frequently
disorderly nature of the meetings, and the large number of casualties
involved; though these were the ostensible reasons often given for the
interdiction of all unauthorized gatherings of the kind. Much, however,
depended on the character and temperament of the reigning monarch,
and the condition of order or otherwise prevailing in the country at
the time. At tournaments, whether held by royal licence or not, the
combatants were divided into two camps or parties; and they gathered
together large concourses of spectators, who were too apt to become
strong and eager partisans, as we see at the football games of to-day;
the unpopular side being sometimes assailed with volleys of stones,
some discharged from slings. These meetings were thus frequently looked
upon with disfavour by the powers that be, and were either entirely
prohibited, or licences were refused in troublous times; for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
assemblage of so many influential knights and powerful barons with
their feudatories, coming from all parts of the kingdom, constituted a
danger to the state in affording opportunities for cabals, sedition and
other disorders, and, indeed, tumults frequently occurred. Tournaments
were very popular in France during the reign of Philip Augustus; and
Père Daniel relates an incident of that reign affording a striking
example of the large gatherings that assembled. An unexpected attack
having been made on the town of Alençon, the king was enabled to enrol
a sufficient force at a tournament being held in the neighbourhood at
the time to repel it. Jousting was not much practised in France at that
time or during the thirteenth century, the cavaliers of that country
preferring the <i>mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1196 King Philip Augustus “sent vnto King Richard,
requiring him to appoint fiue champions, and he would appoint other
fiue for his part, which might fight in listes, for triall of all
matters in controusee betwixt them, so to avoid the shedding of more
guiltlesse bloud. King Richard accepted the offer, with the proviso
that either King might be of the number, that is the French King one of
the fiue vpon the French part; and King Richard one of the fiue vpon
the English part. But this condition would not be granted.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1250 “was a great tornie and iusts holden at Brackley,
when the earle of Gloucester (contrarie to his accustomed manner)
fauoured the part of the strangers, whereby they prevailed. In so much
that William de Valance handled one Sir William de Odingesselles verie
roughlie, the same Sir William being a right worthy knight.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In 1251 King Henry III forbad the holding of a round table<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and many examples of such prohibitions are given in <i>Foedera</i>. Yet,
meetings of the kind were often held in England in spite of them, for the
young cavaliers, imbued with the chivalrous spirit of the age, declined
being balked of their favourite pastime and were willing to run some
risks for its gratification. In the reign of Henry III the king
admonishes his subjects “to offend not by tourneying,” and, “by the
advice of parliament enacted, that all who (without leave) should keep
a tournament, should forfeit their estates, and their children to be
disinherited.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
As late as the reign of King Edward II an edict was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
issued against the practice, the ordinance running “<i>Turneare</i>,
<i>burdeare</i>, <i>justas facere</i>, <i>aventuras quaerere</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Prohibitions against tournaments were issued in the years 1220, 1234, 1255
and 1299. In normal times, however, they were often encouraged by the crown,
and were presided over, and even taken part in, by kings and princes.
Matthew of Westminster states that it was customary for newly made
knights to pass over to the Continent to show their mettle by feats
of arms; and that King Henry III knighted eighty gentlemen on one
occasion, who all went abroad, accompanied by Prince Edward, to take
part in tournaments.</p>

<p>In the early days of tournaments there were only five authorized
lists (<i>champs clos</i>) in England, and they were all south of the
Trent. At a later period these enclosures were usually placed in the
neighbourhood of a large town where there was a hall spacious enough
for the banquet and the dance; the size of the lists being regulated
by the number of cavaliers expected to take part. Those of the twelfth
century were open at the sides, a barrier standing at each end; later
they were made quadrangular in shape, longer than broad by one-fourth.
They were enclosed by a double row of palisading, high enough to make
it impossible for a horse to leap over; the space between the rows
affording a place of refuge for the varlets (ephebi) and attendants.
The <i>rôle</i> of the varlets was to rush in and steady their masters in
the saddle, when swaying after their careers; and, when unhorsed, to
extricate and drag them, as opportunity offered, out of the press or
from among the horse’s hoofs in the <i>mêlée</i>; for they were unable to
help themselves in their heavy armour. This duty was both difficult
and dangerous, but they had to manage as best they could. Openings
were left at either end of the lists for entrance and exit, and
movable barriers were provided for closing them when required. A thick
covering of sand was strewn on the ground, or it was well mulched with
tanning refuse so as to provide a soft bed for breaking the force of
the fall of a cavalier when unseated. The lists were gaily decorated
with tapestry, bunting and heraldic devices; a tribune for the umpire
or judge, and benches for the spectators, were provided; as well as
special galleries for the ladies, which were often adorned with gold
and silver embroideries. Two pavilions were pitched for the use of the
leaders, which were removed before the commencement of the tourney.
The scene presented by a tournament must have been brilliant in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
extreme; and the element of danger involved would add greatly to
the interest and excitement of the spectators. Permanent lists were
often surrounded by a ditch or moat. The marshals of the lists,
kings of arms, heralds and pursuivants-at-arms were stationed within
the enclosure to note the various incidents taking place among the
combatants; and it was the duty of the first-named to see that the
rules of chivalry and general regulations were strictly observed.
Trumpets announced the entry of each competitor, who was followed
into the lists by his esquires; and flourishes of music were heard
at intervals to animate the combatants, and to mark special feats of
gallantry. Each knight usually bore on his person some token of his
lady-love, which was disposed on his helmet, lance or shield. The
armour and horses of the vanquished fell as spoil to the victors,
unless ransomed by payment in money; this, however, was the case only
in contests of courtesy. The jousting at a tournament usually ended
with “<i>le coup ou la lance des Dames</i>,” a homage to the fair sex
joyfully rendered.</p>

<p>We have seen that blunted lances were in use in 1252, but we have not
found any record of the coronal, a lance-head formed like a flattened
crown (whence the name), before very early in the fourteenth century,
when it appears on a picture in a MS. in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Cavaliers frequently successful in the tourney enriched themselves by
the forfeiture of the horses and armour of the vanquished.</p>

<p>The routine of an early tournament is described in Codex 69 of the
Harleian MS.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
It is first proclaimed over a wide area; and on assemblage the
cavaliers, mounted on horseback, are divided into two parties or
squadrons, the challengers and the challenged. Each troop usually
varied in number from twelve to twenty, and was headed by its own
leader; the weapons were pointless swords with rebated edges. The
two bodies then take up positions at opposite ends of the lists; the
onset is sounded, “<i>Lasseir les aler</i>,” and they engage in combat
until the signal is given to cease fighting. Various perquisites fall
to the superintending Norroy King at Arms, and he and the heralds
are paid their expenses and six crowns of “nail money” for affixing
the cote-armour of the two leaders in front of their pavilions. An
illustration on a MS. of the thirteenth century in the royal
library<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
is reproduced in <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>. It pictures the entry on
horseback of the two baron-leaders into the lists, wearing chain-mail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and pointed bascinets, and with their horses trapped; they bear no
weapons. The King of Arms, in civil dress, is standing between them
holding their banners, one in each hand. Trumpeters are seen in the
background.</p>

<p>The presence of ladies graced the tournament, and they were treated
with great deference; the names and deeds of the successful champions
were submitted to them, and it was they who awarded and presented
the prizes. The days of combat usually closed with the banquet and
the dance. The tourney from the first was confined to men of noble
birth, though this rule was not so strictly enforced in England as in
Germany and France, where all not of the privileged class were strictly
excluded.</p>

<p>The first mention we have found of prizes at tournaments is in 1279,
when, at the Round Table held at Kenilworth in that year, the prize (a
golden lion) was awarded to Sir Roger Mortimer; but they do not seem to
have become general until much later.</p>

<p>Henry III, on his marriage with Eleanor of Provence, in 1236, held a
tournament for eight successive days; and according to Matthew Paris,
there was one at Northampton in 1247, another at Nebridge in 1248.</p>

<p>The tournaments held during the reign of Richard I were frequently
interdicted by the Church owing to the brutal character of many of
them; and Jocelin of Brackelond tells the story of a number of knights
who held one between Thetford and Bury St. Edmunds, in spite of the
fiat of the abbot. Another took place soon after, which had also been
prohibited; and all who had taken part in it were excommunicated.
Matthew Paris describes a tournament held at Rochester in 1251, at
which foreigners contended with English knights. There was great
bitterness at the time between some of the nationalities owing to very
rough treatment that had been experienced by some English knights
abroad; and all rules and regulations were thrown to the winds at
Rochester, the proceedings degenerating there into a free fight. The
English set upon the foreigners with staves, beating them severely,
and chased them into the town, to which they fled for refuge. Another
instance of this kind may be cited in an account given by Matthew
of Westminster of a case in 1253, when the Earl of Gloucester and a
companion took part in a tournament abroad, at which they were so
roughly handled as to require fomentations and baths before they were
in a condition to return to England. Trivet relates a further striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
example in a case, lawless and brutal in its character, which received
the name in history “<i>La petite Bataille de Chalòns</i>.” Edward I, King
of England, was travelling through France in the year 1274 on his way
home from the Holy Land to take possession of the crown, when he was
invited by the Count de Chalôns to take part in a tournament to be
held in the open, near the town of Chalôns, with a certain number of
his followers. At an early stage of the contest the Count, a knight
of unusual strength, forcing his way through the <i>mêlée</i> attacked the
King with great vigour and impetuosity; and casting away his weapons
threw his arms around King Edward’s neck, hoping to unhorse him. The
King, however, being a tall and powerful man kept his saddle, and at
the moment of the greatest pressure cut fiercely at his adversary,
dragged him from his horse and threw him heavily to the ground. The
exasperation of the French cavaliers on seeing their leader fall was
very great, and for a time a real battle ensued, in which the outside
followers of both sides took an active part, the English using their
terrible bows: but some degree of order having been at length restored
the count surrendered to the King and acknowledged him to be the
victor. After this tournament laying hands on an opponent was strictly
forbidden. Thomas of Walsingham also gives a spirited account of this
meeting, which runs on similar lines.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>At Whitsuntide in the year 1256 great jousting was held at Blei, when
the Lord Edward, afterwards King Edward I, “first began to shew proofs
of his chiualrie.” In one of these encounters “William de Longspee was
so brused that he could never after recover his former strength.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>“In the ninth year of King Edward’s reign, the feast of the round table
was kept at Warwike with great and sumptuous triumph.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The Round Table assembled at Kenilworth by Sir Roger Mortimer has been
already referred to in the section devoted to the Tabula Rotunda, and
Hardyng in his <i>Chronicle</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
thus pictures it:</p>

<p>Hardyng died about the year 1465, nearly two centuries after the events
he narrates.</p>

<p>The lance, or glaive as it is often called, of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
was quite straight and smooth; a vamplate was added in the fourteenth,
small at first but larger later, for the protection of the right
arm. The lance for jousting was made of soft wood, so as to splinter
easily.</p>

<p>A manuscript in the Record Office, transferred from the Tower about
1855, entitled <i>Emptiones facte per manum Adinetti Cissoris et visu
Albini ＆ Roberti de Dorset contra Torniamentum de Parco de Windsore,
nono die Julii anno Sexto</i> (a Roll of Purchases made for the tournament
held at Windsor Park in the year 1278), is copied in <i>Archæologia</i> of
the year 1814.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
This document is of rare value in giving particulars
of the equipment of the cavaliers engaged in tournaments of the last
quarter of the thirteenth century, besides mentioning other matters of
interest. Thirty-eight cavaliers took part in the tournament at Windsor
Park, twelve of the highest rank being styled <i>digniores</i>. Among these
were the Earls of Cornwall, Gloucester, Warren, Lincoln, Pembroke and
Richmond;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and there were several foreign knights present. Many of the cavaliers whose
names appear on the roll had been with King Edward in the Holy Land. Both arms
and armour<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
were provided for the occasion for all the cavaliers taking part.
Thirty-seven of the outfits ranged in cost from 7<i>s.</i> to 25<i>s.</i> each;
that for the Earl of Lincoln, however, was much higher than any of
the others, being 33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> The equipments must thus have differed
widely in quality and embellishment. The armours were of leather gilt,
each suit consisting of a coat-of-fence (being a “quiretta”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
of leather), brassards of buckram, a surcoat (the material for the majority of these garments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
being carda,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
but those for the four earls were of cindon silk), a pair of ailettes, of leather
and carda,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
two crests (one for the man, the other for the horse), a shield of wood
heraldically ensigned, a helm of leather, and a sword of whalebone and
parchment, silvered over. The shields of wood cost 5<i>d.</i> each, without
emblazonment; the swords 7<i>d.</i> each, and 25<i>s.</i> was paid for silvering
the blades, and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for gilding the hilts. The helmets for the
“<i>digniores</i>” were gilded at an expense of 12<i>s.</i>, the others silvered.
Each helmet cost 2<i>s.</i>, and the ailettes 8<i>d.</i> the pair. Eight hundred
little bells (<i>grelots</i>) were provided, to be used in necklets for the
horses; sixteen skins for making bridles; twelve dozen silken cords for
tying on the ailettes;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
and seventy-six calf-skins for making crests. The cuirasses and
helmets were made by Milo, the currier; and the cost of carriage for
the whole of the sets from London was 3<i>s.</i> The sum total for all
these outfits provided in England was £80 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but some other
purchases were made in France, and in the list are items for saddles
and horse furniture. There is no mention of lances, and many of the
items scheduled are only open to conjecture. Sir Roger de Trumpington,
whose effigy lies in Trumpington Church, Cambridgeshire, was among
those taking part in the tournament. If one can imagine this passage of
arms, its participants armed with swords of whalebone and parchment,
with their arm-defences of buckram, it does not seem a very dangerous
affair, though a rough enough sport.</p>

<p>There is another document of about the same period of the highest
importance, viz. the <i>Statuta de Armis</i>, or <i>Statutum Armorum
in Torniamentis</i>. This was drawn out at the request of the earls
and barons of England and by the king’s command, and affords much
information as to the equipment for the tourney late in the thirteenth
century, the usages to be observed, and the regulations as to the
heralds, esquires, and varlets. There are several copies extant, one of
which, and that perhaps the most reliable, may be seen in the Bodleian
Library. Part of the text is reproduced by Hewitt in his invaluable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
work on ancient armour,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and the document is referred to in <i>Archæologia</i> of the year
1814.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
These statutes provide that:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>No “conte,” baron or other chevalier shall henceforth be attended by
more than three armed esquires, who shall all bear the cognizance of
their master.</p>

<p>No knight or esquire taking part in any tournament shall bear a
pointed sword or dagger, a staff or baston, but only a broadsword for
tourneying. All should be armed with “mustilers;”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
“quisers;”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
“espaulers;”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and “bacyn,”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
and no more.</p>

<p>If any “conte,” baron or other chevalier break any of the rules of
the tourney, he shall, with the assent and command of the Seigneurs,
Sire Edward, fiz le Rey; Sire Eumond, frère le Rey; Sire William de
Valence; Sire Gilbt de Clare; and Cunto Nichole,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
lose horse and armour and be imprisoned at the discretion of the
said court of honour, and all disputes shall be referred to it for
settlement.</p>

<p>Any esquire to a knight breaking the regulations in any way should
lose horse and armour and be imprisoned for three years; and none was
allowed to raise up a fallen knight but his own appointed esquire,
bearing his device. Spectators were prohibited the wearing of armour or
the carrying of arms. Etc.</p>
</div>

<p>May we see in the comparative mildness of these rules, and the control
exercised by the court of honour, some results of King Edward’s own
dangerous experiences at the Chalôns tournament.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that the effigies of two of the members of
this distinguished committee have been preserved, viz.: those of Edmund
Crouchback, whose sword-belt is enriched with heraldic bearings; and
William de Valance. Both are in Westminster Abbey. The figure of the
former wears the coif or hood of mail; the body is covered by a surcoat
with long sleeves and reaching nearly to the ankles; but poleynes or
knee-kops can be discerned. In the case of the other effigy the surcoat
is sleeveless and shorter than the other, reaching down to just over
the knees. Poleynes are present, but there are no coudes. A concave
triangular shield hangs by the belt. Chain-mail; quilted stuffs, often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
reinforced with rings or studs of iron, bone or horn; ordinarily
dressed leather and <i>cuir-bouilli</i>, which is leather boiled or
beaten—were all quite capable of resisting an ordinary sword-stroke or
lance-thrust.</p>

<p>An effigy of the twelfth century in the Temple Church, London, that
of Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, dating in the year 1144, in
the reign of Stephen, exhibits the knight completely encased in mail,
wearing a coif of mail of the same fabric, and over it is the tall
cylindrical, flat-topped helm. It was found, however, that certain
vital and more exposed parts of the body required further protection,
for the mail, far from presenting a glancing surface towards the
strokes and thrusts from weapons of attack rather afforded them a
lodgment. The mail therefore became gradually reinforced over the
most vulnerable places with pieces of leather or plates of iron until
a full panoply of metal plating had been attained, a process which
had not been quite completed before the first decade of the fifteenth
century. The course of transition can best be followed by a study of
brasses and effigies. The Crouchback and de Valence effigies show us
that but little progress in the direction of plate-armour had been made
up to the end of the thirteenth century, though after that time the
transition became rapid.</p>

<p>The usual knightly panoply was a coif of mail and beneath it a cap of
cloth, worn in battle with or sometimes without a surmounting helm; the
tunic; the gambeson or pourpoint, of quilted cloth; the hauberk, of
chain-mail; the chaussons, which covered the upper part of the leg; the
chausses, the lower; and the surcoat.</p>

<p>Chain-mail is probably a fabric of Eastern origin, consisting of forged
iron rings, each ring interlinked with four others. This web must
have been somewhat of a rarity even as late as the eleventh century,
and, indeed, until the process of wire-drawing had been invented,
owing to the laborious and costly nature of its manufacture. Each ring
required to be cut from a long strip of wire, hammered-out from the
solid, then interlinked, riveted, forged or butted together. The Romans
employed chain-mail, as shown by the compressed masses which have been
found, but whether it was interlinked in the manner just described is
doubtful. Hauberks of quilted stuffs, reinforced with rings or studs of
iron, bone or horn, were much in use; and so were those of ordinarily
dressed leather; or of <i>cuir-bouilli</i>, which is leather prepared by
boiling and beating. All these defences were quite capable of resisting
an ordinary sword-stroke or lance-thrust.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The arming of the horse with a bard of chain-mail or its substitutes
did not take place before the third quarter of the thirteenth century;
the trapper came into use somewhat earlier, though probably not painted
or embroidered with heraldic bearings before the reign of Edward I.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
fourteenth century was eminently a period of transition and
development in arms, armour, jousts, tournaments, and, indeed, in
everything that related to warfare. During its course chain-mail
harness had been gradually replaced by iron plate, bit by bit; a
process hardly completed at the end. It was a century of almost
incessant fighting among the nations, in the East as well as in the
West; and the knightly armour of the period in its advancing stages
lies open as a book before us, in a study of our effigies and brasses.</p>

<p>An epoch-making detonating force had come into operation, which
inaugurated a new era in the art of war. In its early days ordnance was
greatly inferior in destructive power to most of the mechanical engines
of the period, but by the end of the century it had developed to an
extent which produced a revolution in the relative resources at command
for attack and defence; and the old chivalry became at length second in
importance to the infantry arm.</p>

<p>Contemporary information regarding the jousts and tournaments of the
earlier part of the fourteenth century is sparse; they are described
in the <i>Romances of Richard Cœur de Lion, Sir Ferumbras</i>, and others,
which teem with improbabilities though still of the greatest value;
and there is a pictorial representation in <i>Roman du roy Meliadus</i>
of “<i>Une Mêlée de Tornois</i>”.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
This romance, probably written about the middle of the century,
contains several pictorial examples of jousts and tournaments, and a
wealth of coloured and gilded drawings on military subjects generally;
while others are figured in the Froissart plates<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>,
Hefner’s <i>Tratchten</i> and Carter’s <i>Painting and
Sculpture</i>. It is to Froissart that we are immeasurably most indebted
for information regarding these martial games, more especially those of
the second half of the fourteenth century, and his recitals contain much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
invaluable detail, which had been industriously collected from heralds,
pursuivants, kings-of-arms and other officials at the tourney.
Froissart was born about the year 1337, and he began to gather the
material for his history when about twenty years of age, viz. eleven
years after the battle of Crecy. <i>The Chronicles</i> commence with the
coronation of Edward III, in 1337, and with the accession of Philip
of Valois to the crown of France, and they close about the end of the
century with the death of Richard II of England. At the beginning of
his career Froissart was closely associated with the English court as
a poet and historian, acting, indeed, as clerk to the closet to Queen
Philippa, after which he entered the Church, becoming later canon
of Chimay. His fine personal gifts soon placed him in excellent and
confidential relations with many prominent and influential personages,
both of France and England, able to give him reliable information for
his history. His industry was remarkable, his style of writing both
original and luminous, and his facts and narrations, though often
marshalled with some confusion, are most reliable, so far at least as
we can judge now. He was no extreme partisan, but tried, as he often
says, whenever possible to hear both sides to a question. The weak
place in his history is his dates and the lack of them. Sainte-Palaye
says of him: “<i>Froissart, qui a mieux réussi qu’acun de nos historiens
à peindre les mœurs de son siècle</i>, ...”</p>

<p>Royal jousts were often held in celebration of the coronations and
weddings of princes; and such were usually proclaimed in advance in
other countries of chivalry, so as to afford opportunities for the
attendance of foreign cavaliers anxious to distinguish themselves; and
these were provided with safe-conducts by the crown.</p>

<p>In 1302 “Tournies, iustes, barriers, and other warlike exercises,
which yovng lords and gentlemen had appointed to exercise for their
pastime in diuerse parts of the realme, were forbidden by the
kings proclamations sent downe to be published by the shirifs in
euerie countie abroad in the realme: the teste of the writ was from
Westminster the sixteenth of Julie.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>A tournament was proclaimed by the King of Bohemia and the Earl of
Hainault, to be held at Condé in 1327, just after the coronation of
Edward III; and Sir John de Hainault, who had been present at the
ceremony, left England to attend this tourney, accompanied by fifteen
English knights, who intended taking part.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

Holinshed states that in September, 1330, the King (Ed. III) held
jousts in Cheapside, when he with twelve challengers answered all
comers. The meeting continued over three days, and no serious accidents
took place.</p>

<p>A joust of the same year is figured in <i>Codex Balduini Trevirencis</i>.
The cavaliers are seen jousting with lances tipped with coronals
and with flat triangular shields, heraldically ensigned: they wear
ample surcoats and the horses are trapped in cloth. The heaumes bear
fan crests, the saddles are without supports; and the object in
contemplation is the splintering of lances and unhorsing.</p>

<p>“Great iustes was kept by King Edward at the toune of Dunstable in
1341, with other counterfeited feats of warre, at the request of
diuerse yovng lords and gentlemen, whereat both the king and queene
were present, with the more part of the lords and ladies of the
land.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>King Edward held a tournament in London in the middle of August, 1342;
and had sent heralds into Flanders, Brabant and France to proclaim it.
Froissart states that the eldest son of Viscount Beaumont<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
was killed at this tournament. Other chroniclers date this passage
of arms in 1343.</p>

On the reverse of the last leaf is a picture of a Joust, wherein two

<p>The Round Table held at Windsor on St. George’s Day in 1344 has been
referred to in the section devoted to the <i>Tabula Rotunda</i>. These
hastiludes and jousts are mentioned by Froissart, who tells us that
they were characterized by great splendour. The Queen was attended on
the occasion by three hundred ladies, richly attired; while the King
had a great array of earls and barons in his train. The “feast” was
noble, with all good cheer and jousting, and lasted over fifteen days.
Holinshed’s account, under the year 1344, is as follows:—“Moreouer,
about the beginning of the eighteenth yeare (?) of his reigne, King
Edward held a solemne feast at his castell of Windsore, where betwixt
Candlemasse and Lent, was atchiued manie martiall feasts, and iusts,
and tornaments, and diuerse other the like warlike pastimes, at which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
were present manie strangers of other lands, and in the end thereof,
he deuised the order of the garter, and after established it, as it
is to this daie. There are six and twentie companions or confrers of
this felowship of that order, being called knights of the blew garter,
and as one dieth or is depriued, an other is admitted into his place.
The K. of England is euer chiefe of this order. They weare a blew robe
or mantell, and a garter about their left leg, richlie wrought with
gold and pretious stones, hauing this inscription in French vpon it,
Honi soit qui mal y pense, Shame come to him who euill thinketh. This
order is dedicated to S. George, as chéefe patrone of men of warre, and
therefor euerie yeare doo the knights of the order kéepe solmne his
feast, with manie noble ceremonies at the castell of Windsore, where
King Edward founded a colledge of canons.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after this round table the King issued letters patent for
hastiludes and jousts to be held annually at Lincoln, over which the
Earl of Derby was nominated as Captain by the King, the office to be
retained by the earl during life-time, but after his death to become
elective.</p>

<p>The “Feast of the Round Table” was again held at Windsor in 1345, and
within a few years of it jousts took place at Northampton, Dunstable,
Canterbury, Bury, Reading and Eltham, the exact years of which do not
appear in the wardrobe accounts which have been preserved. In July,
1346, King Edward invaded France, and did not return to London until
October, 1347, his home-coming being celebrated by jousts, tournaments,
masques and other festivities.</p>

<p>A manuscript covering the expenses of the great wardrobe of Edward III
from December, 1345, to January, 1349, now in the Public Record Office,
is printed in <i>Archæologia</i> for the year 1846.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Some of the items scheduled cover robes for the person, which were
delivered to certain of the knights taking part in a “round-table” held
by the King at Lichfield in 1348 or 1349, more probably the former
year; viz. for the King’s person and eleven knights of his chamber,
these being Sir Walter Manny, John de L’Isle, Hugo Courtenay, John
Gray, Robert de Ferrers, Richard de la Vache, Philip de Spencer, Roger
de Beauchamp, Miles de Stapleton, Ralph de Ferrers and Robert de
Mauley. To each of these knights two yards of blue cloth for coats and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
“three quarters and half a yard” of white cloth for hoods<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
was delivered. Similar cloth was also issued to some of the other
knights. The challengers, or <i>tenans</i>, of the round table consisted of
the king and seventeen of his knights; their opponents, the <i>venans</i>,
comprised fourteen knights, with the Earl of Lancaster at their head.
An entry in the wardrobe accounts shows that King Edward wore a harness
bearing the arms of Sir Thomas Bradeston on the occasion. Any further
particulars of this round table, beyond the details of the robes for
the banquet, are lacking. This tournament was celebrated with great
pomp and magnificence.</p>

<p>A spirited verse from Chaucer’s “Knight’s Tale” follows:—<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>We see in the <i>Romance of Perceforest</i> how the ladies at a tournament
tore off pieces of their apparel to be used as tokens or favours by
their devoted knights, to an extent leaving them in a condition of
dishabille. A knight often wore “a kerchief of pleasance” on his
helmet, a token from his lady-love.</p>

<p>In 1358 “Roiall iustes were holden in Smithfield, at which were present
the Kings of England, France and Scotland ... of which the more part of
the strangers were as their prisoners.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>“Moreouer, this year (1359) in the Rogation wéeke was solemne iusts

“Moreouer this yeare (1362) the fiue first daies of Maie, were kept
roiall iusts in Smithfield by London, the king and queene being

<p>Much detailed information concerning the jousting of the fourteenth
century has fortunately been preserved in the records of the wars in
France, some examples of which follow.</p>

<p>At the time when the siege of Tournay was raised by means of a truce, a
tournament was held at Mons, at which Sir Gerard de Verchin, Seneschal
of Hainault, was mortally wounded.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Froissart states<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
that a combat took place before the walls of the town of Rennes in
1357, then being besieged by the English forces, between <i>a young
knight-bachelor</i>,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Bertrand du Guesclin, and an English cavalier, Sir Nicholas Dagworth.
The articles of combat provided for three courses with the lance,
three strokes with the battle-axe and three thrusts with the dagger.
These were all duly delivered, the knights bearing themselves right
gallantly, without hurt to either of them. The fight was viewed with
extreme interest by both armies.</p>

<p>So far Froissart. But there is some doubt whether it was Sir Nicholas
Dagworth who was one of the principals in this duel; for in the
<i>Histoire de Bretagne</i> it is stated that it was William de Blanchbourg,
brother of the Governor of Fougerai, who was Sir Bertrand’s opponent
on the occasion, and that he was wounded and unhorsed. It is more
probable, however, that both duels were fought, though the last-named
combat was not likely to have taken place under the walls of Rennes,
for both cavaliers were Frenchmen.</p>

<p>There is a singularly beautiful brass in the pavement of the south
chapel of Blickling Church, Norfolk, in memory of Sir Nicholas
Dagworth, who was a man of importance in the reigns of kings Edward III
and Richard II. He lived until the year 1401,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and his will appears in <i>Testamenta Vetusta</i>. The brass is given in
the Boutell Collection. It affords an excellent example of the armour
prevailing at the end of the fourteenth century, when the evolution
from chain-mail to full plate-armour had been almost completed. The
helmet is the pointed bascinet, with the camail, the latter with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
ornamental bordering coming over the top of the jupon. The cyclas,
which has an enriched fringing, hides the body-armour from view,
and the knightly belt is elaborately decorated; the pouldrons are
articulated. The gauntlets, with short cuffs, have gads over the
fingers for use in the <i>mêlée</i>, and they show an imitation of
finger-nails, and the solerets are freely articulated. The knight’s
head rests on his great helm, which has a mantling; and a wreath,
surmounted by the crest, a griffin. The armour is enriched with
chasing. The Arms—Erm, on a fesse, gu., three bezants: impaling Rosale,
Cu., a fesse between six martlet’s or.</p>

<p>The armour of the Black Prince in the Chapel of the Holy Trinity, at
Canterbury Cathedral, affords an excellent illustration of the degree
of progress reached in the last quarter of the fourteenth century. The
process of evolution from chain-mail to plate is here almost completed,
there being only small pieces of the former at the skirt, arms and
insteps of the solerets. The Prince died in 1376, and the date of his
effigy is somewhat later.</p>

<p>During a skirmish at Toury, in France, shortly before the death of
King Charles V, in 1380, an esquire of Beauce, named Gauvain Micaille,
enquired through an herald if any English gentleman would be willing
to try a feat of arms with him—a joust of three courses, and the
exchange of three blows with the battle-axe and of three thrusts with
the dagger. The challenge was accepted by an English esquire, named
Joachim Cator. The Frenchman received a severe wound in the thigh in
the jousting, which was in contravention of the rules of the tourney;
but the Englishman pleaded that it was an accident solely due to the
restiveness of his horse; and this explanation was accepted by the
umpire.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>An interesting tournament took place at Cambray in 1385 on the marriage
of the Count d’Ostrevant to the daughter of Duke Philip of Burgundy.
The ceremony was followed by a banquet at which the King of France
was present as well as the Duke. The tournament was held in the
market-place of the town, and forty knights took part, the King tilting
with a knight of Hainault. The prize was a clasp of precious stones,
taken from off the bosom of the Duchess of Burgundy; it was won by a
knight of Hainault, Sir John Destrenne, and was formally presented by
the Admiral of France and Sir Guy de la Trimouille.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The number of courses run in jousting and the blows and strokes
exchanged with battle-axes, swords and daggers at a meeting like that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
just described was usually three each; but they tended to increase as
the century advanced, and five got to be a common number, and later as
many as ten or even twelve. In the duel between Sir Thomas Harpenden
and Messire Jean des Barres, at Montereau sur Yonne in 1387, they
numbered “<i>cinq lances à cheval, cinq coups d’épée, cinq coups de dague
et cinq coups de hache</i>.” The first four courses of the jousts were run
with equal fortune, but in the fifth Sir Thomas was unhorsed and lay
senseless on the ground; he revived, however, after a time, and all the
strokes and blows were duly exchanged without further hurt to either
knight. The King of France was present on the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>About this time, when the war between France and England was in full
progress, there was much jousting with pointed lances between the
knights and esquires of the two nations; safe-conducts being issued by
the commanders on either side.</p>

<p>A meeting was arranged to take place near Nantes, under the auspices of
the Constable of France and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter
was a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers
was slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance
without further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir
Tristram de la Jaille of Poitou advanced from the ranks and jousted
three courses, without hurt. A duel followed between Edward Beauchamp,
son of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and the bastard Clarius de Savoye. Clarius
was much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. The
bastard then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire
named Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat
with swords and lances was very violent, but neither of the parties
was hurt. Another encounter took place between John de Châtelmorant
and Jannequin Clinton, in which the Englishman was unhorsed. Finally
Châtelmorant fought with Sir William Farrington, the former receiving
a dangerous wound in the thigh, for which the Englishman was greatly
blamed, as being an infraction of the rules of the tourney; but an
accident was pleaded as in the case of the duel between Gauvain
Micaille and Joachim Cator. At this meeting the honours lay with the
Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Somewhat later a combat <i>à outrance</i><a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
took place at Chateau Josselin, near Vannes, between John Boucmel, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Frenchman, and Nicholas Clifford, in which Boucmel was struck on the
upper part of the breastplate by his opponent’s lance, which, glancing
off, entered his neck through the camail and severed the jugular vein,
killing him instantly.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
A plate of Froissart’s represents this duel as a combat on foot with long
lances, taking place in a small quadrangular enclosure.</p>

<p>Juvenal des Ursins states<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
that at the marriage of Charles VI, of France, with Isabel (Isabeau)
of Bavaria, 1385, jousts and grand fêtes took place in its honour.
Sir Peter Courtenay came to France at the time with the object of
accomplishing a feat of arms with the Seigneur de la Tremouille.
The King’s consent to the duel had been obtained, and the day and
place were fixed for its accomplishment. The knights appeared in the
lists on the day appointed in order to fulfil their engagement in
presence of the King, who, however, at the last moment, owing to some
remonstrances, forbade the combat: but a duel did take place at the
time between an English knight and the Seigneur de Clery, in which the
Englishman was wounded and unhorsed. This joust had been brought to the
notice of the Duke of Burgundy, who said that the offence committed
by a Frenchman in jousting with an enemy without the consent of his
sovereign was worthy of death; his Majesty, however, at length pardoned
the offender.</p>

<p>Froissart describes a realistic tournament, held at Paris during the
wedding festivities, as between the Saracens under Saladin, and the
Crusaders, led by Richard Cœur de Lion.</p>

<p>The feat of arms between Sir John Holland and Sir Reginald de Roye, a
French chevalier of distinction, held at the town of Entença, before
the King and Queen of Portugal and the Duke and Duchess of Lancaster,
presents features of its own. The French knight sent an invitation to
the Englishman entreating him to joust with him three courses with the
lance, and to exchange the same number of strokes with the battle-axe,
sword and dagger, for the love of his lady. The challenge was promptly
accepted, and an answer returned by the herald, together with a
safe-conduct for the Frenchman and his company. Sir Reginald arrived in
due time at Entença, handsomely accompanied by six score knights and
esquires. The meeting was held in a spacious close in the town, the
ground well strewn with sand; and galleries had been erected for the
accommodation of the royal and ducal parties, with other spectators.
The jousting was to be with sharp lances, to be followed by a contest
with sharp and well-tempered battle-axes, swords and daggers. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
champions were well mounted and rode into the lists in full armour,
taking up positions for their careers at either end of the lists, with
the distance of a bow-shot between them. The signal for the onset
having been sounded, the knights charged each other at the gallop, and
Sir Reginald struck the bars of his opponent’s visor so stoutly that
his lance splintered on impact. Sir John Holland also struck the visor
of his adversary well and fairly, but the helmet of the Frenchman,
instead of having been securely laced to his body-armour as was usual,
was only held by a single thong, and of course slipped off, leaving the
knight bare-headed and Sir John’s lance unbroken. The jousters then
returned to their stations, and charged each other as before, and again
the same thing happened, owing to the same cause. The English who were
present regarded the unusual loose fastening of the helmet as a trick,
but the umpire, the Duke of Lancaster, ruled that it was admissible
for Sir John Holland to have employed the same artifice had he chosen
to do so, and that therefore he could not decide against the French
knight.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
After the stipulated three courses with the lance had been run, the
knights fought three rounds each with battle-axes swords and daggers,
without either receiving a scratch. The French chevalier was adjudged
to have had the advantage, though both had done well.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>In 1389 a deed of arms was performed at Bordeaux before the Duke of
Lancaster, between five Englishmen and five Frenchmen: three courses
with the lance, three courses with swords, and the same number with
battle-axes. None was wounded, but one of the English knights killed
the horse of a Frenchman with his lance, which greatly angered the
Duke, who replaced the loss with one of his own chargers.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The most prominent and accomplished jouster of his day was the
Chevalier Jean Le Maingre, called De Boucicaut, Mareschal of France
1368-1421, and his <i>Mémoires</i>,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
by an unknown author, contain descriptions of some of his exploits in the tiltyard. One of these
recitals<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
follows:—During the three years’ truce between France
and England, when King Charles VI was at Montpellier,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
the French Seigneurs De Boucicaut, de Sampi and de Roye challenged all comers,
being foreign knights and esquires, to joust five courses with lances,
pointed or blunted, at their pleasure, at St. Ingelbert,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
a place near Calais; the <i>pas d’armes</i> (or the “<i>table-ronde</i>,” as it
is called in the <i>Chapitres d’Armes</i>, or articles of combat) to continue for
thirty days. A great elm stood before the pavilions of the challengers,
and hanging from its branches were two shields of wood, one of them
plated with iron, “<i>l’un de paix, l’autre de guerre</i>,” so that each
venant on arriving at the rendezvous could signify his pleasure as
to whether he elected to fight with pointed or rebated lances by
striking with a wand the shield for peace or that for war. The arms
and devices of the three tenans were painted above the two shields,
so that each venant might be able to select his adversary among them,
and a note blown on a horn proclaimed his choice. Each venant was to
furnish the king of arms with his name and titles, and to bring another
cavalier with him as his sponsor. The lists were richly decorated, the
challengers handsomely apparelled; and lavish hospitality was dispensed
in a pavilion specially pitched for the purpose. Any arms, armour, or
other requisites of which the venans might stand in need, were freely
provided, the motto everywhere displayed being “Ce que vouldrez.” The
chronicle goes on to state that on the first day of the jousting,
Jean de Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, half-brother to King Richard,
signified his intention of jousting with Boucicaut. Both lances were
fairly splintered in the first encounter, the second and third being
fought with equal fortune; but in the fourth the horse of the English
knight fell with its rider, who was severely injured, his antagonist
only retaining his seat by the prompt support of his varlets. Boucicaut
then retired to his pavilion, but was not allowed to remain resting
for long, for other English cavaliers desired to joust with him, and
he disposed of two other knights the same day. While he was engaged
in combat day after day, his fellow tenans were not idle, and the
thirty days stipulated in the <i>Chapitres d’Armes</i> ran their course.
Among other cavaliers from England taking part were Earl Marschal,
the knights de Beaumont, Thomas de Perci, de Clifford and Courtenay,
besides Sir John d’Ambreticourt and many Spanish and German cavaliers.
Boucicaut is said to have gone through the whole thirty days of
jousting without a scratch.</p>

<p>The rôle of the tenans at a <i>pas d’armes</i> was no sinecure, and for
three knights to have held the <i>pas</i> for thirty days against all
comers, as in this case, must have been an arduous undertaking; and
very dangerous also, more especially as much of the jousting was with
pointed lances. No. XI of Froissart’s plates professes to depict one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the jousts of this <i>pas d’armes</i>; but it pictures one at the tilt,
so that the drawing is obviously of a later date than that of the
Inglevert meeting, and was, in fact, executed in the reign of Edward
IV, when the tilt was in common use. Froissart<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
gives a long and circumstantial account of this meeting, and states
that it was very richly appointed. King Charles of France was present
incognito, and had subscribed very handsomely towards the heavy
expenses incurred.</p>

<p>Monkish chronicles, written in times not contemporaneous with the
events they describe, are usually unreliable in being coloured with
the circumstances of a later age; and any illuminations or wood-cuts
accompanying them are apt to reflect the times in which they were
executed, rather than those they are represented to portray, for the
artist fills in his picture with the details of the scenes before him.
However, with the accumulated knowledge we now possess, we are enabled
to correct some of the mistakes, from a chronological point of view.</p>

<p>A royal tournament was held in London by King Richard II, immediately
after the Michaelmas of the year 1390, in honour of Queen Isabella;
and heralds were sent to proclaim it throughout England, Scotland,
Hainault, Germany, Flanders and France. Sixty knights were to joust
with rebated lances, as tenans, for two successive days, the Sunday and
Monday, against all comers; and the Tuesday following was set apart for
the esquires. The jousting was to be followed by banquets, dances and
sumptuous fêtes and entertainments of various kinds. The prizes for the
Sunday were as follows:—A rich crown of gold for the best lance among
the venans; and, for the most successful among the tenans, a very rich
golden clasp. Those for the Monday are not stated; but for the Tuesday,
the esquires’ day, they were a handsome charger, fully accoutred, and a
falcon, for the best lances of the venans and tenans, respectively. The
ladies were to act as judges and to present them. The Sunday’s jousting
was called the feast of the challengers. At three p.m. the procession
started from the Tower of London. Sixty barded chargers, an esquire
mounted on each, advanced at a foot’s pace; then sixty ladies of rank
richly apparelled and mounted on palfreys, rode in single file, each
leading a knight, in full armour, by a silver chain. The procession
thus formed proceeded along the streets of London, down Cheapside to
Smithfield, attended by minstrels and trumpeters. The King and Queen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with their suites, accompanied by some of the great barons, had gone
earlier to Smithfield, and there awaited the arrival of the procession
and the knights from abroad. Their Majesties were lodged in the
Bishop’s palace, and there the banquets and dances were to be held.
Many foreign knights and esquires attended, and among them Sir William
of Hainault (Count d’Ostrevant)<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and the Count de St. Pol.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the procession at Smithfield the knights mounted
their horses and prepared for jousting, which began soon after. The
prize for the best lance of the venans on the Sunday, the first day
of jousting, was awarded by the ladies to the Count de St. Pol; and
that for the most skilful knight among the tenans, to the Earl of
Huntingdon.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
The King led the tenans on the Monday; and the prize for the best
lance of the venans was awarded to the Count d’Ostrevant; that for the
most successful of their opponents to Sir Hugh Spencer. The esquires
jousted on the Tuesday, after which there was a banquet, and dancing
was continued until daybreak. There was jousting on the Wednesday for
knights and esquires indiscriminately; and on Thursday and Friday
fêtes, masques and banquets, after which the royal party left for
Windsor.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Caxton refers to these royal jousts in the following terms:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“All of the King’s hous were of one sute, theyr cotys,
theyr armys, theyr sheldes and theyr trappours were embrowdred all with whyte
hertis, with crownes of gold about their necks, and cheynes of gold
hangyng thereon; whiche hertys were the King’s leverey, that he gaf to
lordes, ladyes, knyghtes, ＆ squyers, to know his houshold peple from
other; then four and twenty ladyes comynge to the justys, ladde<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
four and twenty lordes with chynes of gold, and alle in the same sute
of hertes as is afore sayd, from the Tour on horsback thrurgh the
cyte of London into Smythfeld.” The narrative of this tournament by
Holinshed<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
is far from being so picturesque as that of Froissart, and it differs
in some particulars from it. He says there were twenty-four ladies, not
sixty, mounted on palfreys; and that the prizes for the first day were
awarded to the Comte de St. Pol and the Earl of Huntingdon; and on the
Monday to the Earl of Ostravant and Sir Hugh Spencer.</p>

<p>King Richard proclaimed another grand tournament to be held at Windsor
in one of the closing years of his reign; the tenans or challengers to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
be forty knights and forty esquires, clothed in green. The Queen was
present, but very few of the barons attended, owing to the great
unpopularity and arbitrary actions of the King,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
whose reign had begun under the happiest auspices, but the manifest
defects in his character brought his career to a sorrowful ending.</p>

<p>There was a kind of tourney called the <i>Espinette</i> held at Lille, in
honour of a relic preserved there, which, though obscure, would seem to
have been but an ordinary joust with which certain annual ceremonies
were connected. Hewitt<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
quotes the <i>Chronicle of Flanders</i> concerning a celebration in the year
1339:—“Jehan Bernier went to joust at the <i>Espinette</i>, taking with him
four damsels, namely, the wife of Seigneur Jehan Biensemé, the wife
of Symon du Gardin, the wife of Monseigneur Amoury de la Vingne, and
mademoiselle his own wife. And the said Jehan Bernier was led into the
lists by two of the aforesaid damsels by two golden cords, the other
two carrying each a lance. And the King of the <i>Espinette</i> this year
was Pierre de Courtray, who bore Sable, three golden Eagles with two
heads and red beaks and feet.” M. Leber gives some account of the <i>fête
de l’épinette</i> in the <i>Collection des traités</i>.</p>

<p>The vamplate, <i>avant-plate</i>, placed on the shaft of the lance, for the
protection of the right hand and arm, first appears in the fourteenth
century; and so does the lance-rest on the breastplate. An ordinance
of the thirteenth century orders the lance to be blunted for the
tourney; but in the fourteenth it was ordered to be tipped with a
coronal, the short points of which were just sufficient to catch on
to the armour without being capable of piercing it. The helmet of the
fourteenth century was the pointed bascinet, with the camail or hood
of mail worn over the top of the cyclas. The great heaume used early
in the fourteenth century differs little from that of the end of the
thirteenth; later it assumed the form of a cylinder, surmounted by a
truncated cone. It was usually of iron, though sometimes of leather,
either ordinary or of <i>cuir-bouilli</i>. The fan crest, doubtless adopted
from a classic prototype, came into vogue in the last quarter of the
thirteenth century, though it is represented on the seal of King Richard I.</p>

<p>Crests were made of various materials. Those for the cavaliers taking
part in the tournament at Windsor Park, in 1278, were of calf-skin,
one for the man and another for the horse, as shown in the Roll of
Purchases; that of the Black Prince, at Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
was of cloth. They were attached to the helm by means of a thin iron bar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Crests were usually affixed to the great helm, which was worn over the
bascinet; though there are instances of their being used alone on the
smaller head-piece.</p>

<p>The heraldic crest does not appear before towards the close of the
thirteenth century; a notable instance may be cited in the case of
the remarkable effigy of Sir John de Botiler, in St. Bride’s Church,
Glamorganshire, which dates about the year 1300. The helmet of this
monument is the cervellière, which is a visor-less, saucer or shallow
basin-shaped head-piece, going over the hood of mail; and the crest
is embossed on its front. Crests were not generally worn before about
the end of the first quarter of the fourteenth century, after which
period they develop from comparative simplicity into fantastic and even
ridiculous conceptions.</p>

<p>A strange fancy was the cap-of-maintenance, the placing of a cap of
velvet or other material on the helm, surmounted by the family crest;
and in the second half of the century or a little later the orle or
wreath and mantling or lambrequin are added.</p>

<p>The shield of the century was of the triangular kite or heater-shaped
form.</p>

<p>In 1390 “John de Hastings earle of Pembroke, as he was practising to
learne to ioust, thrugh mishap was striken about the priuie parts, by a
knight called Sir John S. John, that ran against him, so as his inner
parts being perished, death presentlie followed.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>In 1398 the Earl of Crawford, of Scotland, jousted <i>à outrance</i>, i.e.
with sharp lances, with Lord Wells of England at London Bridge, the
23rd April, being the feast day of St. George. An attaint was made in
the first course, and both champions kept their seats. The Earl sat
so steadfast in his saddle under the shock that the by-standers cried
out that he was locked to his seat, on hearing which he jumped off his
horse and then vaulted back into his saddle again with such agility as
greatly to astonish the people. In the second course they met again
as before without either being hurt; but in the third Lord Wells “was
borne out of the saddle and sore hurt with a grieuous fall.”</p>

<p>Not long after a duel on horseback took place in Scotland between
Sir Robert Morley, an Englishman, and Sir Archibald Edmounston, and
afterwards with another Scot Hugh Wallace, and the first-named was the
victor in both cases; but he was at length overcome by one Hugh Traill,
at Berwick, and died shortly after from chagrin.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> fifteenth century
marks a very distinct epoch in the history of the tourney, which
became milder and less dangerous to life and limb; and during its
course a stricter observance than hitherto of the rules, regulations
and limitations prescribed were progressively more strictly enforced,
and their infringement subjected the offenders to severe and sometimes
degrading penalties. An oath to observe the rules of chivalry was
administered to all cavaliers taking part in the tournament.</p>

<p>Body-armour had proved inadequate to resist the then weapons of attack,
and at the commencement of the century, or perhaps a couple of decades
earlier, the armour-smith was especially directing his attention
towards the strengthening of the knightly harness. The chief seat of
the industry for the greater part of the century was at Milan, at which
city armour was forged of such strength as to be capable of resisting
thrusts with the lance and strokes from the terrible battle-axe, sword
and mace practically without fracture; and one meets with references in
English and other records to orders being sent to Milan for harnesses
of proof, a civil garment being forwarded to indicate the stature and
build of the person, since ill-fitting suits would be apt to chafe the
wearers. But, while the best and most costly harnesses came from Italy,
less expensive equipments were imported into England from Germany;
for “<i>ostling</i>” (Easterling) armour is sometimes mentioned in English
articles of combat, and it was probably obtained through the agency of
the Hanseatic Confederation from their London depôt, the Steelyard,
then situated in what is now Lower Thames Street, London. The cost of
carriage also would be much less from Germany.</p>

<p>The great armour-smiths of Milan at the period immediately under review
were members of the Missaglia Negroli family, which, like many others,
carried on their craft for several generations. The Germans have always
been wont to borrow the inventions and processes of other nations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
then often to cheapen them; and so it was with body-armour. They
gradually succeeded, under the personal inspiration and direction of
the Emperor Maximilian, in transferring the bulk of that industry, even
in the best harnesses, to German soil, until at length cities like
Nuremberg and Augsburg became the chief seats of the manufacture; and
indeed the bulk of the armours preserved to us of the later “Gothic”
and “Maximilian” styles are of German make. That Maximilian engaged
armour-smiths from Italy is seen by a contract made in 1494<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
with the Milan armourers Gabrielle and Francesco de Merate, to erect and
equip for him a smithy in the town of Arbois, in Burgundy, to forge
there a certain number of harnesses at fixed prices. The armour worn
by Maximilian I at Worms, in 1495, in a combat on foot with the
Burgundian, Claude de Vaudrey, bears the stamp “m,e,r,” surmounted by
a crown, the Milan mark of these smiths, who came next in celebrity to
the Missaglias.</p>

<p>Many ameliorations were conceived in the fifteenth century with a view
to further minimizing the risk of serious accidents, and one of the
most far-reaching and important was the application of the tilt in
jousting. Many injuries had befallen the riders in the tourney by the
collision of their horses, sometimes by accident, at others by design,
and the idea of the tilt was conceived greatly with a view towards
obviating this danger. The tilt, or <i>toile</i>, was at first a rope
hung with cloth, stretched along the middle of the lists, but later it
became a barrier of planks, along which the tilters charged in opposite
directions, their bridle-arms towards it, their lances held in rest in
their right hands on the tilt side of the horse’s neck, striking the
polished, glancing surface of their adversary’s armour at an angle. The
tilt had the advantage of lending a fixed direction to the jousters in
their careers, though they often failed to touch each other. With the
danger of these collisions removed, the knight ran his course with but
little risk.</p>

<p>Jousting in the open with pointed lances was, however, continued by a
hardier type of jousters until long after the introduction of the tilt;
and here the saddle was without cantle, so as to offer no impediment to
unhorsing; and a cushion or mattress, stuffed with straw, was placed
over the chests of the horses, to act as a buffer in case of collision.
A rough game it was for a cavalier to be unseated and thrown to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
ground in his heavy armour, sometimes carrying a weight of two hundred
pounds; though his fall was broken by the ground of the lists being
covered with thickly strewn sand or mulched with refuse from the
tan-yard. This form was much practised in Germany, though strange
to say but little harm would seem to have been experienced by the
champions in their falls, greatly owing to the extensive padding
of their harnesses. Other important departures in the direction of
comparative safety were the designing of special forms of armour for
the tiltyard, and the introduction of additional or reinforcing
pieces, for doubly protecting those parts of the body on which the
brunt of the attack fell, viz. mainly on the left side. They first
appear in England in the reign of Edward IV. “William Lord Bergavenny
bequeathed to his son the best sword and harness for justs of peace and
that which belong to war.”</p>

<p>The vamplate of this century was much enlarged, for the protection of
the lance-arm; and the steels of the saddles lent great protection to
the bodies of the jousters below the breast. The effect of all this was
to encase those taking part in the tourney in an almost impenetrable
shell, from which they could barely see or do more than couch and aim
their lances.</p>

<p>Armour for the lists became sharply divided from that employed for
“hoasting” purposes, as harnesses for the field were called, though in
what country the change had its origin, whether in Burgundy, Italy or
Germany, is uncertain. It was in use in Burgundy in the year 1443, for
we read in the account given in <i>Mémoires D’Olivier De La Marche</i>,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
that during the time the necessary preparations were being made for
the tournament held at L’Arbre de Charlemagne, Dijon, in that year,
the young cavaliers practised jousting before the duke “<i>et là furent
faictes une jouste à selles plattes et en harnois de joûte</i>.”</p>

<p>Harnesses for the lists assume different forms in Germany from those
in Italy. In the first-named country in the case of the armour for
jousting in the open, so to speak, the breastplate was flattened on
the right side for better couching and aiming the lance, which was
supported by a <i>Rasthaken</i> or queue behind, as well as by a lance-rest
in front, while in Italy the cuirass continued rounded in form. The
lance-rest (<i>Rüsthaken</i>) assumed various forms, though usually that of
a curved bracket. Reinforcing pieces were employed in all courses.</p>

<p>There is another variety of armour which was used in <i>Scharfrennen</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
but it, with the others, will be particularly described and illustrated
later on. Jousting at the tilt prevailed greatly in England, though
abroad many other varieties were practised as well. Jousting lances
were often painted or ornamented with party-coloured puffs of cloth
along their length. Lance-heads assumed various forms, examples of
which may be seen in several of the German museums and in the Tower of
London. Illustrations are given by Boeheim.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
The shafts varied in form, weight and thickness for the different courses.</p>

<p>The armour for combats on foot was made very strong and heavy, and so
padded with under-clothing as to cause faintings and even deaths in
hot weather. Foot-fighting was rendered much safer by the introduction
of “barriers,” over which the champions fought, but they do not appear
much before the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The physical strain on those taking part in a tournament must have been
great, and the combatants weary at the end of a long day; nevertheless
they joined the ladies in the evening, when the successful competitors
received the prizes from their hands; and after the banquet came the dance.</p>

<p>The century saw the mingling of the tourney with the pageant; the
<i>mêlée</i> had been much supplanted by the joust, which demanded more
individual skill, for in the throng and confusion of the <i>mêlée</i> the
element of chance helped certain of the combatants to a distinction
beyond their real deserts; while in the joust, which was a contest between
two champions only, each had to stand or fall solely on his own merits.</p>

<p>A favourite form of the tourney of the fifteenth century was the
<i>Kolbenturnier</i> or baston course, which differed essentially from all
the others in that no personal injury was intended in the contest, the
object being to batter off the crest which decorated the helm of an
adversary; and it was thus purely a game or trial of skill. The weapon
employed was a <i>Kolben</i>, a heavy polygonally-cut baston or mace of hard
wood, about 80 cm. in length. The <i>Kolben</i> swells out along its shaft
to an obtuse point, has a round pommel, short grip, and a rondel-guard
of iron. There is an illustration of this weapon in the <i>Tourney-book
of René d’Anjou</i>. The helm, a huge, globose form of bascinet, was
latticed over the face with strong iron bars, and screwed to the
cuirass back and front; it was thickly lined inside and roomy enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
prevent any injury which might be caused by the heavy blows exchanged.
It was covered outside with leather and painted with various devices.
A fine example of this type of helm is at Dresden, and Boeheim in
<i>Waffenkunde</i>,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
figures one of them in the Collection Mayerfisch at Sigmaringen.
The saddle was the high one, known as the <i>Sattel im hohen Zeug</i>;
an example, of the second half of the fifteenth century, is in the
Germanische National Museum at Nuremburg. The <i>Kolbenturnier</i> ceased
being run about the end of the first quarter of the sixteenth century.
It was at first practised on foot, and doubtless grew out of the
Judicial combats with the baston of the lower classes. Boeheim in
<i>Waffenkunde</i><a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> illustrates Duke Georg of Bayern-Zandshut, at
Heidelberg, armed for a <i>Kolbenturnier</i> in 1482: from Hans Burgmaior’s
<i>Turnierbuch</i>, in possession of the Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.</p>

<p>The crests of the fifteenth century are most fanciful and fantastic,
such as a crowned unicorn or the tail of a fox; many examples may be
seen in the tourney-book of King René, the Beauchamp pageants, the
German tourney books, and other works of the kind; and René describes
their construction very fully. They are fragile and made greatly of
the same materials as those of the century preceding, though oftener
of <i>cuir-bouilli</i>, which substance was more substantial and enduring.
The tapestry at Valenciennes, which pictures a <i>mêlée</i> of the fifteenth
century, shows numerous fragments of crests lying on the ground under
the hoofs of the horses. The knights prized their crests greatly; and
they were often buried with them. They were fixed in position by an
iron bar or brooch; an example of the latter may be seen at the Musée
d’Artillerie, Paris. Sometimes the horse was also provided with a
crest, as in the tournament at Windsor Park in 1278.</p>

<p>The hours during which <i>fêtes d’armes</i> took place show that the
lists were frequently artificially lighted, and, indeed, torches and
flambeaux are sometimes mentioned.</p>

<p>Tournaments held at the royal and princely courts of the countries
of chivalry were strictly games, the hosts often challenging their
guests to trials of skill; and some correspondence preserved of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, between German princes, shows what
a great part these martial sports played in the routine of their daily
lives; second only, if even that, to the chase. Kurfürst Albrecht von
Brandenburg, writing to a friend in the last quarter of the century,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
says:—“<i>Wir sind yor mit gots hilff die fordersten im Turnier gewesen
und gedenkens aber zu bleiben</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Maximilian, writing, at the age of nineteen, to Sigmund Pruschenk,
remarks:—“<i>Ich hab das pest gethan, wann ich hab VIII stechholz
zerstossen</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Much depended on the docility and training of the chargers, which
were often ridden blindfolded, and they were sometimes influenced by
a spirit of combat like their riders. The bodies of the horses were
padded and covered by the trapper, which fell down almost to the
ground, considerably hampering their motions; a mattress of straw,
crescent-formed, protected their chests;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
their ears were sometimes stopped with wool or oakum; the head and tail
frequently decorated with feathers; and the animals advanced towards
each other at a hand-gallop. The rowel-spurs had long necks. Each
variety of joust had its own special type of saddle, devised with the
object of making unhorsing either difficult or easy as the case might
be. These saddles will be described in their order. Each prince or man
of rank and fortune kept a considerable number of horses continually in
practice; and the correspondence of the times reveals many requests for
their loan.</p>

<p>It was at the courts of Aix and Burgundy where for long the tourney
was much fostered; and at both it may be said to have been reduced
almost to a science. At the first-named court it was much a matter of
amusement, emulation and relaxation; while in the latter, then the most
brilliant in Europe, it was greatly the policy of the sovereign to
encourage tournaments and fêtes of all kinds. They kept the leaders of
the armies and the chevaliers generally in close touch with the head of
the state and the country, besides providing gladiatorial spectacles
for the duke’s somewhat restless and discontented subjects, who were
often smarting under heavy imposts to provide him with the means for
constant schemes of aggression and a profuse display, and who were
frequently in a state of revolt. After the tragic death of Charles the
Bold, the jousting traditions of the court of Burgundy passed over to
that of Maximilian of Austria, who would seem to have made successful
jousting one of the great objects of his life.</p>

<p>There is perhaps necessarily a certain degree of monotony and
repetition in the narrations of the chroniclers of the joust and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
tourney, but they convey collectively a much clearer idea of these
encounters than a mere bald statement of the leading facts could do,
and they reflect the chivalrous spirit of the times in the incessant
craving of the young cavaliers for notoriety and distinction in the
tiltyard. Many examples of jousts and <i>pas d’armes</i> of the fifteenth
century are given in the <i>Chronique de Monstrelet</i>, the <i>Mémoires de la
Marche</i>, and <i>Chastelain’s Cronique Jacques de Lalain</i>. The <i>Chronicle
of Euguerrand de Monstrelet</i>, with its somewhat irregular continuations
by de Couci and others, commences where that of Froissart leaves off,
viz. in the year 1400; and it has the advantage of being for the most
part contemporaneous in regard to the events it narrates. Monstrelet’s
style of writing is less sprightly and more monotonous than that of
Froissart; but he gives dates to his recitals, which, however, leave
much to be desired on the score of accuracy. The names of personages
and even towns given in the <i>Chronicles</i> are most perplexing, being
frequently so distorted as to make identification an impossibility.
Like Froissart, Monstrelet does not confine himself to the events of
the period under review in France and Burgundy, but deals also with
those of other countries in relation to them. The <i>Chronicles</i>, which
really amount to a history, afford a good insight into the subject of
the jousts and tourneys of the times; and Monstrelet states that his
information was carefully collected from heralds, kings-of-arms and
other officials of the lists. Monstrelet was born about 1390 and died
in 1453.</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque de Bourgogne in the National Library at Brussels

<p>An Ashmolean MS., No. 1116, ff. 137b-86, gives the names and arms of
the sovereigns and knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece (Toison
d’Or) from its institution in 1429 to the twenty-third festival of the
Order, which was held by Philip II, King of Spain, 12 Aug. 1559; it
gives historical accounts of the celebration of the feasts. The MS.,
which is in French, is beautifully written, with the arms tricked.
Other MSS. in the same Collection, 139-66, 167-75b, of the year 1431,
give the statutes and ordinances of the Order.</p>

<p><i>The Mémoires D’Olivier De La Marche</i> teem with spirited descriptions
of numerous <i>fêtes d’'armes</i> held at the Burgundian court during
the reign of Duke Philippe le Bon, which are full of detail; and
several of them bear the impress of having been written by an actual
eye-witness, with ample opportunities for getting information, and
with a sufficiency of technical knowledge for placing the scope and
minutiæ of the encounters accurately and vividly before us. They
also afford invaluable details of the costumes of the period, giving
minute particulars of the dresses, and all matters connected with the
lists. The Seigneur de la Marche was a Burgundian, born about 1425; he
was appointed a page to his master the Duke in 1447, and was dubbed
chevalier after the battle of Montlehéry. He distinguished himself
before Ghent in 1452, was appointed a commissionary to the forces in
1456, was made a prisoner at Nancy in 1476, and died in 1502. The
Mémoires cover a period of about fifty-three years, and form a very
valuable contribution to the history of the tourney. They were first
published in 1562.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Jean de Féore, Seigneur de St. Remy, describes some of the <i>pas
d’armes</i> of the century; and the <i>Traité de Tournois</i>, by Louis de
Bruges, written in the reign of Charles VIII, of France, deals with
others of a later period. The Beauchamp Peageants<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
afford some excellent illustrations of jousts and combats on foot and on
horseback. They are reproduced in the <i>History of the Life and Acts of
Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick</i>, by John Rouse, the Warwickshire
antiquary and historian, who died on the 14th of February, 1491, the
seventh year of Henry VII. Earl Richard was born in 1381 and died
in 1439. Hefner’s plates, Nos. 109 and 138, also picture jousts and
tourneys of this period.</p>

written in 1459, by Antoine de la Sale, contains fifteen large and fine
illustrations of jousts, combats on foot, etc., which, as far as we can
judge, fairly represent such knightly encounters of the period.
Hewitt<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
mentions the equipments and colours, as shown on fol. 39: “<i>Near Knight.</i>—Armour,
iron-colour; feet, black; crest, red flower with gold leaves; saddle,
bridle, and stirrup-leather, red; trapper, blue, marked with darker
blue and lined with white fur. <i>Far Knight.</i>—Armour and feet as
before; crest, gold with red feathers; saddle, buff; trapper, dark with
black markings; bells, gold. Chanfreins both ridged and spiked, gold;
the rest iron. The barrier is red and marked with a deeper red. It will

be observed that, except the helm, the whole armour differs in nothing
from the usual war suit.” The <i>Mémoires of the Sire de Haynin</i><a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
afford some interesting details in connection with <i>pas d’armes</i>.</p>

<p>The rules of the tourney promulgated by René d’Anjou, King of Naples,
Sicily and Jerusalem, and Duke of Lorraine, in <i>Tournois du Roi René</i>,
are most important. They contain many restrictions in the use of
weapons, and all tend towards restraining the violence and disorder
which had hitherto prevailed, and towards rendering these warlike games
less dangerous; and they inculcate a spirit of chivalry, thus doing
away greatly with much of the brutality of the former age. René thought
lances too cumbersome for the tourney, and considered the proper
weapons to be rebated swords and maces. The famous duel between the
dukes of Brittany and Bourbon is described. But little jousting took
place at Aix, the <i>mêlée</i> being preferred. There are several splendid
manuscripts of the King’s writings extant, four of them at Paris,
illuminated by the King himself, and they go into the minutest details
of all which concern the tourney as practised at Aix.</p>

<p>“The Ordinaunce, statutes and rules made by John Lord Typtofte, Erle
of Worcester, Counstable of England by the Kinges commaundment, at

<p>There are several copies of the rules extant. The version here given,
in an abridged form, is taken from the <i>Antiquarian Repertory</i>. It was

<p>A few short rules follow for the <i>mêlée</i> and barriers.</p>

<p>There is much confusion in the nomenclature employed by chroniclers
in their descriptions of these chivalric war-games, and the terms
“<i>tournois</i>,” “tourney,” “joustes” or “<i>joûtes</i>” and “<i>pas d’armes</i>,”
are often confounded with each other, all or any being sometimes used
in a general sense to cover various forms of jousting and the tourney:
and such meetings often received the general appellation of <i>fêtes
d’armes</i>. In a contemporary recital of the meeting in 1559, which
Henry II of France received his fatal wound, the terms “<i>joûtes</i>,”
“<i>tournois</i>,” and <i>pas d’armes</i> are all employed to express the
proceedings as a whole. The term “tourney” is very frequently used to
denote the <i>mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>pas d’armes</i> or passage of arms usually covered a variety of martial
exercises. It was open to all comers, being knights and esquires
qualified to take part, who were invited by proclamation to attend.
The field was held by a certain number of challengers, called “<i>les
tenans</i>” or holders of the <i>pas</i>; while the attacking cavaliers were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
known as “<i>les venans</i>,” or comers, who came to try and wrest the <i>pas</i>
from them. A <i>pas d’armes</i> was also an imitation of an operation of
war, a <i>Scharmützel</i>, in the attack and defence of a supposed position
of strength, such as a pasteboard bridge-head, a castle of wood or
the assumed gate to a town; the contest being waged with all the
ardour of real warfare, though tempered by certain rules, pretences
and limitations. The term <i>pas d’armes</i> is comprehensive, for besides
jousting and strokes with the sword, etc., such meetings often included
combats on foot; and, after the middle of the fifteenth century,
contests on horseback with the baston or mace; and they often concluded
with the tourney proper or <i>mêlée</i>, troop against troop.</p>

<p>In the <i>Antiquarian Repertory</i><a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
is the following account of a <i>pas d’armes</i> held about the end
of the fifteenth century:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“The king assigns to four maidens of his court
the umpireship of the castle called ‘Loyall’; for the attack and
defence of which they are to arrange as they may collectively decide
upon. The castle is a mock fortress, representing one which had been
subjected to a remarkable siege in history. The ladies confide its
guard and custody to a captain and fifteen cavaliers to defend the
‘pas’ against all comers. A unicorn is placed within the lists, the
four legs of which support as many shields, coloured white, red, yellow
and blue respectively. The first shield signifies the opening jousts at
the tilt, to be run in ‘hoasting’ armour, with double or reinforcing
pieces; the second shield denotes that in the tourney which follows the
jousting twelve strokes with the sword are to be exchanged; the third a
combat on foot at barriers, the same number of strokes with one-handed
swords; the fourth, the defence and assault of the castle, with swords,
shields and morris-pikes. The points and edges of all the weapons
employed in the four sections to be rebated, only the foyne<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
excepted. Any cavalier, except the leader of either side, if taken
prisoner, may be ransomed with three yards of satin, but captains must
pay the cost of thirteen yards for their freedom. The <i>pas d’armes</i> to
continue from the 27th November to New Year’s Day. The hours, after the
first day, from one in the afternoon to seven in the evening.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Other clauses in the <i>Chapitres d’Armes</i> are:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="neg-indent">“Item. Yt shalbe lawfull for the assaulters to
devise all manner of engynes for the wynenge of the said castell; engyn
or tole to breake the ground or howse with all only excepted.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Item. None do meddell with fier neyther within or
without but to fire their gunnes.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Item. If any man be disarmed, he maye withdrawne
himselfe if he will; but once past the barres, he may not com agayne
into the torney for that daye. Also there shall no man have his servant
within the barres with any peace of harnois, for no man shalbe within
the said barres but such as shalbe assigned by the king’s grace.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Item. Who shall beste demeane himselfe at thee
same arte of armes, shall have a sword, garnished, to the valew of
three hundred crownes or under.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Item. If any man strike a horse with his speare,
he shalbe put out of the torny withowt any favour; and if any slaye
an horse, he shall paye to the owner of the said horse an hundred
crownes in recompence; also yt is not to be thought that any man will
slaye an horse willingly; for if he do it, it shall be to his great dishonor.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Item. He that uses a close gauntlet (a locking or
forbiden gauntlet) shall win no prize.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Item. He that his sword falleth owt of his hand,
shal win no prize.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The gaining of prizes in jousting was settled as a rule by a counting
of points, for and against, and they were usually:—</p>

<p>Breaking a lance fairly on the body of an adversary, below the helmet,
1 point; above the breast, 2 points; unhorsing, 3 points. Points
would be lost by striking the saddle or the tilt. A lance should be
splintered more than a foot above the head.</p>

<p>The long wars between France and England had engendered much hatred
and bitterness between the nations, and frequent combats in the
lists, <i>à outrance</i>, continued to take place between the respective
cavaliers, many of which fights were characterized by great violence
and ruthlessness. Matters at length got to such a pass that in the
year 1409 the French King issued an ordinance against all such combats
between cavaliers of the two nations.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Certain combats, however, continued to take place under royal licence.</p>

<p>In the year 1400 by advice of the Earl of Huntingdon, “solemne iusts
were to be enterprised between him and 20 on his part, and the earle of
Salisburie and 20 with him, at Oxford.” This was a conspiracy for the
assassination of King Henry IV, but the plot miscarried.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1400 Michel d’Oris, an esquire of Arragon, sent to Calais,
by a pursuivant-at-arms, a challenge to a deed of arms, addressed to
the Cavaliers of England, in the following terms:—</p>

<p lang="fr" class="blockquot">“Au nom de Dieu, et de la benoite vierge
Marie, de saint Michel et de saint George, je, Michel d’Oris, pour
mon nom exhausser, sachant certainement la renommée des prouesses de
chevalerie d’Angleterre, ai, au jour de la date de ces présentes, pris
un tronçon de gréve à porter à ma jambe jusqu’à tant qu’on chevalier
du dit royaume d’Angleterre m’aura délivré à faire les armes qui
s’ensuivent. Premièrement, d’entrer en place à pied, et d’être armé
chacun ainsi que bon lui semblera, et d’avoir chacun sa dague et son
épée sur son corps, en quelque lieu qu’il lui plaira, ayant chacun une
hache, dont je baillerai la longueur. Et sera le nombre des coups de
tous les bâtons et armes ensuivant: c’est à savoir: de la hache, dix
coups sans reprendre. Et quand ces dix coups seront parfaits et que
le juge dira: Ho! nous férirons dix coups d’épée sans reprendre ni
partier l’un de l’autre, et sans changer harnois. Et quand le juge aura
dit: Ho! nous viendrons aux dagues et férirons dix coups sur main. Et
si aucun de nous perdoit ou laissoit cheoir un de ses bâtons, l’autre
pourra faire son plaisir du bâton, qu’il tiendra jusqu’à ce que le juge
ai dit: Ho! Et les armes à pied accomplies, nous monterons à cheval; et
sera armé du corps chacun ainsi qu’il lui plaira, et aura deux chapeaux
de fer paraux, lesquels je liverai; et choisra mon dit compagnon lequel
qu’il lui plaira des deux chapeaux: et aura chacun tel gorgerin qu’il
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
lui plaira, et avec ce, je baillerai deux selles, dont mon dit
compagnon aura le choix. Et outre plus, aurons deux lances d’une
longueur; desquelles lances nous férirons vingt coups sans reprendre,
à cheval, sur main; et pourrons férir par devant et par derrière,
depuis le faux du corps en amont. Et icelles armes de lances faites
et accomplies, ferons les armes qui s’ensuivent: C’est a savoir, s’il
advenoit que l’un ou l’autre ne fût blessé, nous serons tenus après, en
icelle journée même et au second jour après, férir de coups de lance à
course de chevaux à trois rangs, tant que l’un ou l’autre cherra par
terre ou soit blessé, si qu’il n’en puisse plus faire. Et que chacun
s’arme à sa volonté le corps et la téte. Et les targes soient de nerfs
ou de cornes, sans ce qu’elles soient de fer ni d’acier, ni qu’il y ait
aucune maîtrise. Et courrons les dites lances atout les selles que les
dits chevaux auront, faisant les dites armes à cheval: et chacun liera
et mettra ses étriers à sa volonté, sans faire nulle maîtrise. Et pour
y ajouter plus grande foi et fermeté, je Michel d’Oris, ai scellé cette
lettre du sceau de mes armes: laquelle lettre fut faite et écrite à
Paris le vendredi vingtième jour d’Août l’an 1400.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>This letter is given in full, for it affords much first-hand
information in a concrete form of the procedure of a combat of the
period as well as the manner of such cartels.</p>

<p>The letter states that the Spaniard had attached to his leg “<i>un
tronçon de gréve</i>,” being a piece of a greave (armour for the shin),
presumably of iron, causing him pain and inconvenience, which he had
vowed to continue wearing until delivered from it by a combat with a
gentleman of England. To this end he had sent his cartel to Calais,
proclaiming his wish for such an encounter, laying down very precise
conditions for a fight at which ten strokes with the axe, ten with
the sword, and the same number of thrusts with the dagger were to be
exchanged; to be followed by twenty courses with lances, on horseback.
The pursuivant duly delivered the letter at Calais, where it was seen
by Sir John Prendergast, who accepted the challenge in his own person,
on behalf of the chivalry of England, subject, of course, to the
permission of his sovereign to the duel being obtained. No reply being
forthcoming from the Spaniard within a reasonable time. Sir John sent
him a letter, stating that the time and place for the combat had been
arranged, and an umpire appointed. There being still no reply, another
letter followed demanding an answer, and at length one arrived, with
excuses for the delay and complaining that Sir John had broken the
treaty in an umpire having been chosen without the name having been
first submitted to him; though showing no burning desire to have the
matter arranged to his own satisfaction. The correspondence continued
over four years and came to nothing after all; but for how long the
Spaniard continued wearing the piece of greave pricking his leg history
does not tell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1402 the Sire de Harpedenne, Seneschal de Saintonge, having
heard that certain English knights desired to perform a deed of arms
for the love of their ladies, suggested to the Duke of Orleans that six
gentlemen of his household should challenge a like number of English
cavaliers to a combat <i>à outrance</i>. The duke agreeing, the invitation
was duly sent and promptly accepted, the fight to take place near
Bordeaux on the 19th May, 1402. Much pressure was brought to bear on
the duke to induce him to withdraw his sanction, on the ground that
such a combat would tend to increase the bitterness between the nations
which already prevailed; but he continued to encourage the scheme, and
even went to Saint Denis to pray for the success of his countrymen.
Arnault Guilhem, Sire de Barbazan, a chevalier of repute, undertook the
leadership of the French contingent.</p>

<p>The Sire de Harpedenne and the Earl of Rutland were appointed umpires
of the fight; and on the arrival of the French chevaliers at the place
of combat they heard Mass, and the Sire de Barbazan addressed them on
the justice of their cause, animating them to deeds of valour for their
country’s sake; while the Englishmen thought more of a good meal before
fighting. According to the French account of the fight, the Englishmen
had conceived a stratagem for two of their number, by preconcerted
action, suddenly to assail one of the French cavaliers, with the object
of reducing their number to five, as against the English six; but the
plan failed, and it was one of the Englishmen that was killed, thus
turning the tables.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
This gave a preponderance to the Frenchmen, but the fight continued
long, obstinate and bloody, resulting in the victory of the
French.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>In the same year Louis, Duke of Orleans, sent a challenge to Henry
IV, King of England, proposing a combat between them with lances,
battle-axes, swords and daggers, the fight to continue until one of
them surrendered, which the king declined, on the ground that he could
only fight with his equal.</p>

<p>In 1403 a deed of arms, <i>à outrance</i>, was performed at Valentia, four
Spanish cavaliers against four Frenchmen, the King of Arragon acting as
umpire; and the articles of combat provided for a fight on foot with
axes, swords and daggers. The Seneschal of Hainault led the French, and
the Seigneur de Sainte Coulombe, a member of the king’s household, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Spaniards. Highly decorated lists had been erected for the occasion,
and the king took his seat on the tribune, expressing the hope that the
fight might not take place; but the parties urged that great expense
had been incurred, and that the French cavaliers had come from a
distance at heavy charges in answer to the challenge. The king yielded
to these arguments, and gave the signal for the onset. A gallant fight
with axes ensued, during which one of the Spaniards seized a Frenchman
by the leg and was preparing to stab him with his dagger when the king
cast his bâton, putting an end to the conflict, to the great chagrin of
both sides.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

run with lances tipped with coronals, the earl’s crest being the bear
and ragged staff. The armour and general aspect of the picture point
to the period when the Memoir was written rather than to the actual
date of the joust. The tilt is of four planks, and appears to be nearly
six feet in height. The royal party is seated in a balcony overlooking
the lists, and there are raised galleries for the officials and
better-class spectators, and seats on the level of the lists for the
general public.</p>

<p>Plate XX. Sir Pandolf Malatesta sent a challenge to Earl Richard,
first to joust, and “then go togedres with axes; after which armyng
swerdes;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
and last with sharp daggers.” The jousting finished, “they went to
gedres with axes, and if the lord Calcot hadde not the sonner cried
peas, Sir Pandolf sore wounded on the left shoulder hadde been utterly
slayn on the felde.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
The illustration pictures the combat on foot with <i>becs de faucon</i>,
weapons more picks than axes. The helmets are armets, the earl’s crest
his well-known cognizance, and he wears a tabard-shaped surcoat. The
equipment is not contemporaneous with the time of the duel, but rather
that of the date of the Memoir. The plate in <i>Horda</i> is reproduced
on our <a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a>. The copy from the MS. is not quite correct in
the delineation of the weapon wielded by the earl, owing to a blur on the original.</p>

<p>Plate XXVIII pictures a combat on horseback, with rebated swords.</p>

<p>Plate XXXV shows Earl Richard jousting at the tilt incognito. He wears
a “volant-piece.”</p>

<p>In 1415 three Portuguese cavaliers fought the same number of Frenchmen,
at St. Ouen, near Paris, in presence of the King of France. The
combat was a severe one, resulting at length in the discomfiture of
the Portuguese, who succumbed to the Frenchmen. The manner of this
surrender so disgusted the authorities and spectators that the defeated
party was forcibly expelled the lists.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>In 1420 there were several curious subterranean combats, between French
and English cavaliers, at Montereau, that town being then besieged by
the troops of the Dauphin. The English had laid mines extensively under
the walls; and it was in these excavations that the fights took place,
by the light of the flambeaux and torches. The first who fought on the
French side was Louis Juvenal des Ursins, a valiant esquire, son of the
advocate-general, who was dubbed a chevalier on the occasion. The King
of England and Duke of Burgundy were present, and wished to break a
lance together, from which, however, they were dissuaded. The Sire de
Barbazan jousted with the king, at first without knowing who he was,
but as soon as he became aware that it was his Majesty, he respectfully
retired from the contest. Everything passed with great courtesy between
the members of the two nations, and the king gave great praise to the
cavaliers engaged.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In the seventh year of Henry V “triumphant iusts and turneis, in the
whiche, Erle of Arundell, and the Bastard of Sent Polle by the iudgment
of the Ladies, won the price and got the honor.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>A combat on horseback and on foot took place at Arras in
1425,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
between the Sires de Sainte-Treille and Lionel de Vendôme, the Duke
of Burgundy acting as umpire. On the first day the chevaliers ran six
courses with the lance, and de Vendôme was slightly wounded in the head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
The day following they fought on foot with axes of the <i>bec de faucon</i>
type, and de Vendôme attacked his adversary with great impetuosity, but
all his strokes were parried. Sainte-Treille then delivered several
blows on the visor of his opponent, forcing it open, leaving the
face exposed; then hooking his axe in the opening wounded de Vendôme
slightly in the face with his gauntlet, perceiving which the duke cast
his bâton. A joust followed between the Sire de Champremi and the
Bastard of Rosbeque, the latter piercing the armour of his adversary
with his lance, on which the duke’s bâton fell.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The <i>bec de faucon</i> or <i>bec de corbin</i> was a weapon with a curved
beak-like spike or pick, as its name implies, sometimes with a blade
at the opposite side, at others with a narrow <i>mail</i> or mallet, with
four short points, somewhat like those on the coronal to a lance,
though sharper: in both varieties there is usually a long spike at the
head and a point at the foot; strictly speaking, however, a weapon with
a blade can hardly be termed a <i>bec de faucon</i>. An illustration is
given in “Barriers and Foot Combats,” a paper by Viscount
Dillon,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
of a weapon of this kind belonging to Captain Hutton, which has a beak
or pick on one side, and opposite to it a <i>mail</i> or mallet of four
points and a spike at the head. There is another example at the Musée
d’Artillerie, Paris, with a very pronounced beak, but neither <i>mail</i>
nor spear. It is stated in Lord Dillon’s paper that in the duel between
Merlo and de Charny, at Arras in 1435, before the fighting began, an
objection was lodged by Charny’s friends against the Spaniard using a
<i>bec de faucon</i>, axes being stipulated for in the <i>Chapitres d’Armes</i>.
It was contended that the weapon was not an axe at all; but after
some discussion the objection was not pressed. The weapon, which is a
terrible one, does not seem to have been much used in Germany.</p>

<p>In 1428 a grand tournament was held at Brussels. The Duke of Burgundy
attended and was magnificently entertained and feasted by his cousin,
Duke Philip of Brabant, and the City of Brussels. The Lady of Gezebêque
awarded the prizes. The dukes announced their intention of jousting
together, but were dissuaded from doing so by the kings-of-arms, for
fear of accidents. Many cavaliers took part, before a great concourse
of nobles, ladies, and the general public. The prize for the most
successful combatant in the first day’s fighting was awarded to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
gentleman of Brabant named Linquart. On the morrow and following days
there was great jousting, and the Duke of Brabant and the Seigneur
de Mamines were adjudged to be the best lances, and the prizes were
awarded to them. This <i>fête d’armes</i> was distinguished by great
splendour, and banquets, dances, masquerades and other mummeries
continued for several days.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>In 1430 a combat took place in the great market-place at Arras,
between five French and a like number of Burgundian cavaliers, under
the umpireship of the Duke of Burgundy, for the breaking of a certain
number of lances. The French contingent consisted of the Seigneurs
Théode de Valeperghe, Pothon de Sainte-Treille, Philibert d’Abrecy,
Guillaume de Bes and L’Estendard de Nully; that of the Burgundians
of Simon de Lalain, the Seigneurs de Charny, Jean de Vaulde, Nicolle
and Philibert de Menton. The combat was to continue over five days.
Lists were prepared, “<i>garnie d’aisselles, afin que les chevaux ne ce
puissent recontrer l’un l’autre</i>,” and here we have an example of a
joust at the tilt.</p>

<p>On the first day de Lalain jousted with de Valeperghe, when the latter,
with his horse, was thrown violently to the ground. Jousts followed
over the second, third, fourth and fifth days, in which many lances
were broken. In the third course run between de Charny and d’Abrecy,
the visor of the latter’s “armet” was pierced by his opponent’s
lance, causing a very serious wound in the face; and on the last day
the same thing happened to de Nully, in jousting with Philibert de
Menton. The injured knights were removed to their lodgings, and left
behind in charge of the surgeons; both subsequently recovered from
their wounds. On the conclusion of the <i>fête d’armes</i>, the honours lay
with the Burgundians, and the duke loaded the Frenchmen with handsome
presents.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>In 1435 there was a passage at arms at Arras, held under the umpireship
of Duke Philip of Burgundy; and seated on the bench near him were the
dukes of Bourbon and Cueldres, with other noblemen of distinction. The
parties to the duel were Messire Juan de Merlo, a chevalier banneret
of Spain, and Pierre de Beauffrement, Sire de Charny, a banneret of
Burgundy, knight of the Toison d’Or, and one of the most noted jousters
of his day. The articles of combat provided for a joust of three
courses, and then a combat on foot, with axes, swords and daggers,
to be continued until one of the twain was placed <i>hors de combat</i>,
though, as always, subject to the fiat of the judge. The Spaniard
first entered the lists attended by four noble cavaliers, who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
specially attached to his person by the orders of the duke. De Charny
followed, attended by the Comtes d’Étampes, de Saint Pol and de Ligny;
and with them was the Earl of Suffolk, who carried the lances to be
used on the occasion. The champions ran the three courses with the
lance, without mishap to either beyond a slight fracture to the armet
of the Spaniard. This ended the contest for the first day; and on
the morrow the combat on foot took place. It began with the knights
hurling lances at each other, the weapon of the Spaniard striking the
Burgundian on the arm, causing a slight wound, notwithstanding which
the fight continued with axes. The combatants displayed much skill and
gallantry with their weapons, without much advantage to either knight,
when quite unexpectedly the duke cast his bâton, putting an end to
the fight. The Spaniard protested most energetically to the duke at
the combat being brought to so premature an end, urging that he had
travelled a long way in order to achieve this feat of arms, and had
been put to a vast expense. The duke appeased him, however, by praising
his gallantry, and ordered a handsome present in money to be paid to
him to cover his outlay. This duel is remarkable as furnishing an early
instance of fighting with the visor up. To set against the danger of
having part of the face exposed, it gave great advantage in the way
of vision, in clearness as well as in radius. The visor was a mark so
often aimed at, and was in its nature very vulnerable.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>In the twentieth year of King Henry VI a French Chevalier named Louis
de Bueille challenged Rafe Chalons, an esquire of England, to a feat of
arms; and the King of France was present at the meeting. The Englishman
ran the Frenchman through the body and killed him.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Sir John Astley fought on foot with the Chevalier Philip Boyle of
Arragon at Smithfield in the year 1442, King Henry VI acting as umpire.
An illustration in the MS. in the possession of Lord Hastings pictures
quadrangular lists of open railings showing the openings and the bars
for closing them. They are of a kind usually erected for combats of
this nature. King Henry sits in the tribune; and within the lists,
besides the principals, is a herald-at-arms and a guard of four, armed
with battle-axes, for keeping the ring. The combatants wear bascinets;
bases; solerets, <i>à la Poulaine</i>; and tabard-shaped surcoats, on which
the respective arms of the parties are embroidered. Boyle’s axe has a
flook or <i>bec de faucon</i> and an axe-blade; that of Astley’s a blade and
a three-pronged mail or mell. The MS. does not state the issue of the fight.</p>

 <i>pas d’armes</i> was held at L’Arbre de Charlemagne, near Dijon,
in the year 1443,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
presided over by Duke Philippe le Bon, which was proclaimed in most of
the European countries of Christendom. The account of this meeting has
a great historical value, owing not only to its reference to the tilt,
additional pieces, and special forms of armour, but also to the amount
of detail it presents. It is given here in a much abridged form.</p>

<p>Thirteen noble Burgundians of distinction, headed by Pierre de
Bauffremont, Chevalier, Seigneur de Charny, held the <i>pas</i> for six
weeks against all comers. De la Marche remarks that during the time
necessary for erecting the lists and making the general arrangements
for the meeting the young cavaliers practised various forms of jousting
before the duke “<i>et là furent faictes une jouste à selles plattes, et
en harnois de ioûte</i>.” He graphically pictures the general arrangements
for this <i>pas d’armes</i>, the profuse hospitality extended to all
comers, the construction and decoration of the lists, the dresses and
equipments of the officials, pages, combatants, etc. He describes the
lists for jousting as follows, making clear mention of the tilt:—<span lang="fr">“<i>et
au milieu d’icelle lice fut la toille mise, pour la conduitte des
chevaux, et pour servir à la course des hommes d’armes, comme il est de
coustume en tel cas.</i>” “<i>Celle lice fut de bonne hauteur et grandeur:
et, aux deux bouts de ladicte lice, furent faictes deux marches: qui se
montoyent à degrés, faits de ce bonne grandeur, que l’on pouvoit aider
à l’hommes d’armes, tout à cheval, pour l’armer aiser, ou desarmer,
selon le cas: et hors de ladicte lice, du costé de Digeon, aux jours
qu’il besoing faisoit, avoit une grande tente, haute et spacieuse,
tendue, pour aider et soulager le venant de dehors, si mestier en
avoit.</i>”</span> There was another enclosure for combats on foot.</p>

<p>During the duration of the <i>pas</i> two shields were hung suspended in
the lists: one, painted black, besprinkled with gilded tear-drops;
the other, violet, <i>semé</i>, with tear-drops in black. Each venant who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
through a pursuivant, placed a gage, such as a sword or spur, below the
first-named shield, signified his election to engage on horseback one
of the tenans or defenders of the <i>pas</i>, and to run twelve courses,
“<i>à la toille</i>,” that is along the tilt, with sharp or rebated lances
at his pleasure; and should either of the jousters be unhorsed he was
to present his adversary with a diamond of whatever value he pleased.
The venant who placed his gage below the violet shield, with tear-drops
in black, elected a combat on foot, consisting of fifteen strokes with
the axe or estoc;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
but should he place gages below both shields, his challenge applied to
a joust at the tilt and a foot encounter as well. The duke took his
seat on the 11th July, 1443, holding a white wand or bâton in his hand
as judge, which when cast down put an end to a fight at any stage,
the officials at once separating the combatants. We describe briefly
a few of the encounters. The first contest lay between the leader of
the tenans, the Seigneur de Charny, and a Spanish cavalier of mark,
Pietre-Vasque de Suavedra. The chevalier venant having placed gages
below both shields, the combat was to be on foot, to be followed by
another on horseback; and on the opening day the champions entered the
enclosure for foot contests at 9 o’clock in the morning. The choice of
weapons, as between axes and <i>épées d’armes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
lay with the chevalier venant, who chose axes. Eight men-at-arms
in complete armour, bearing white wands, ranged themselves in the
enclosure, to keep the ring and to separate the combatants when
necessary. The duke gave the signal and the combat began. Suavedra
had taken off his visor, while Charny fought with his visor down. The
stipulated fifteen strokes having been exchanged, without bodily injury
to either party, the combatants were separated and left the lists.</p>

<p>On the 13th day of the same month the jousting between the same
cavaliers took place. The Spaniard first entered the lists with his
following, his horse trapped in blue and white silk, and presented
himself before the judge. De Charny followed in like manner, the
trapper of his charger being of cloth of gold; he was attended both by
his esquires and by five pages on horseback, sumptuously attired in
blue and violet satin. The onset having been sounded, the champions
charged, each splintering his lance on the body of his antagonist in
the centre of the lists; in their second career both lances glanced
off, and so on until the number of courses had been run. Challengers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
continued to come forward, and each combat is recorded by the
chronicler in its turn.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August a joust took place between an Italian, Jacques de
Visque, Comte de St. Martin, and the Chevalier Guillame de Vaudrey,
“<i>qui couroit de droit et du long de la toile</i>.” In the first course
St. Martin was struck on the visor of his helmet by the lance of his
opponent, the fastening being broken; in the fourth he was wounded
severely in the lance-arm, the lance-head remaining in the wound, and
the expressions of regret at the occurrence were so general as to show
that serious injuries in such encounters had become comparatively rare.
This mounted contest was followed by a combat on foot between Anthoine
de Vaudrey and Jehan de Compays, Seigneur de Torain. The venant chose
<i>estocs</i>, and a smart fight ensued, without personal injury to either
chevalier, though their armour was much battered and torn.</p>

<p>The chronicler continues his narrations of the various combats which
followed during the remaining days provided for in the <i>Chapitres
d’Armes</i>, throughout the course of which the defenders of the <i>pas</i>
held it against all comers with conspicuous honour and distinction. The
tenans of the <i>pas d’armes</i> made an offering to the Virgin of the two
shields of L’Arbre de Charlemagne, which were hung suspended in the
Church of Nôtre Dame at Dijon.</p>

<p>While de la Marche devotes his narration more to the fighting and
spectacular aspects of the meeting, Monstrelet deals with the
challenges and <i>chapitres d’armes</i>.</p>

<p class="center">THE CHALLENGES</p>

<p>“In honour of our Lord, and his most glorious mother, of my Lady
Sainte Anne, and of my lord St George, I, Pierre de Bauffremont,
lord of Chargny, of Monliet and of Montfort, knight, councellor and
chamberlain, to the most high, most puissant and excellent prince
the Duke of Burgundy, make known to all princes, barons, knights
and esquires, without reproach, with the exception of those of the
kingdom of France and of the countries in alliance, or subjects to my
said sovereign lord, that for the augmentation and extension of the
most noble profession and exercise of arms, my will and intention is,
in conjunction with twelve knights, esquires and gentlemen, of four
quarterings, whose names follow:—Thibault, lord of Rougemont and Mussy;
Messire William Breremont, lord of Sees and of Sauvegon; William de
Brenne, lord of Mombis and of Gilly; John, lord of Valengen; John, lord
of Rap and of Tirecourt; William de Champdivers, lord of Chivigny;
John de Chiron, lord of Rancheinères; Antony de Vaudray, lord of
Aille; William de Vaudray, lord of Collaon; James de Challant, lord of
Ainvilie; Messire Amé, lord of Espirey; and John de Chavigny,—to guard
and defend a <i>pas d’armes</i>, situated on the great road leading from
Dijon towards Auxonne, at the end of the causeway from the said town of
Dijon, at a great tree called the Hermit’s Tree in the form and manner following.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the first place, two shields, (one black besprinkled with tears
of gold,—the other violet, having tears of sable), shall be suspended
on the tree of the Hermit, and all those who shall, by a king at arms
or pursuivant, touch the first shield, shall be bounden to perform
twelve courses on horseback with me, or with one of my aforesaid
knights or esquires, with blunted lances.—Item, if either of the
champions, during their twelve courses, be unhorsed by a direct blow
with the lance on his armour, such person, thus unhorsed, shall present
to his adversary a diamond of whatever value he please.—Item, the
champions may arm themselves according to their pleasure, <i>double or
single</i>,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
but without any wicked intentions, having their rest similar to
the usual custom in war.—Item, each person shall make provision of
lances—but the rondelle, which lies on the hands, shall be only four
fingers broad, and no more.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Item, the lances shall be all of similar length, from the point to the
rest.—Item, for the accomplishment of these feats of arms on horseback,
I will supply all who may come without lances, precisely like to my own
and to those of my companions.—Item, these deeds of arms on horseback
shall be performed <i>à la toille</i>, which shall be six feet high.”</p>

<p class="center space-above1"><i>Chapitres d’Armes.</i></p>

<p>“Those princes, barons, knights and esquires, of the rank before
mentioned, who shall rather take their pleasure in performing feats
of arms on foot, shall touch the violet shield, and shall perform
fifteen strokes with battle-axes or swords, as may be most agreeable to
them.</p>

<p>“Item, if, during these courses, any champion shall touch the ground
with his hand or knees, he shall be bounden to present his adversary
with a ruby of whatever value he please.—Item, each champion <i>shall
be armed with the accustomed armour for combating in lists</i>.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>—Item,
should any person be unprovided with battle-axe or sword, I will
furnish him with the same, similar to my own or to those of
my companions. These axes and swords are not to have anything
extraordinary in their make, but such as are usual in these kinds of
combats.</p>

<p>“Item, he that shall have engaged himself to fight with me, or
either of us, and shall throw the other to the ground, the person so
thrown shall be obliged to surrender himself a prisoner whithersoever
the conqueror shall order him.—Item, the person thus made prisoner
shall pay for his immediate ransom, to whomsoever the conqueror shall
direct, any sum above five hundred crowns.</p>

<p>“Item, foreigners need not seek for particulars from me, or from my
companions, for they will find persons ready to deliver such at the
usual hours and places.—Item, no stranger will be permitted to enter
the lists with me or with any one of my companions, for more than one
course at arms, namely, once on horseback and once on foot—and no one
can require more of any of us during the present undertaking.</p>

<p>“Item, the aforesaid feats of arms, on horseback and on foot, shall
be performed on the following days: those on horseback on Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays; those on foot, Thursdays, Fridays and
Saturdays.</p>

<p>“Item, this pas d’armes shall commence on the first day of July in
the year 1443, and shall last forty days, exclusive of feast-days and
Sundays, and the feasts commanded to be kept by the court of Rome.</p>

<p>“Item, no prince, baron, knight or esquire, shall pass within a
quarter of a league of the spot assigned for these combats without
entering the lists and taking part, or otherwise leaving as pledges his
sword or spurs, according to his pleasure.</p>

<p>“Item, for the accomplishment of these feats of arms, as well on
horseback as on foot, according to the articles above specified, I have
most humbly supplicated and entreated my aforesaid sovereign lord, that
he would grant me his licence and permission to perform them, which
he has most benignantly assented to. He has likewise most graciously
appointed, as judge of the lists, that puissant prince and my most
redoubted lord, the count of Nevers and of Rethel—and in his absence,

<p>Lacroix in <i>Military and Religious Life in the Middle Ages and
Renaissance</i>, gives a picture of a king of arms proclaiming a
tournament; copied from a miniature in King René’s tourney-book.</p>

<p>During the meeting of the Chapter of the Toison d’Or, at Ghent in 1445,
duels were fought between the Chevalier Jehan de Boniface (Jean de
Bonifazio), an Italian, and a Burgundian cavalier, Jacques de Lalain,
the latter then a young man of twenty-four years, who later achieved
great celebrity as a combatant in the lists. Duke Philip of Burgundy
acted as umpire, and was supported on the tribune by the Duke of Orleans;
and immediately before the fight began Lalain was dubbed a chevalier.</p>

<p>Lists had been prepared, and after the usual preliminaries were over a
combat on foot between the parties took place, followed by many courses
at the tilt.</p>

<p>The combatants entered the lists for the fight on foot, each bearing
a heavy sword in the right hand and in the left a <i>hache d’armes</i>; a
smaller sword was attached to the belt, and small rectangular shields
were carried on the left arms. Lalain fought with part of his face
exposed, half of his visor having been removed. The parties took up
their positions some distance from each other, and the fight began by
Boniface hurling his spear at Lalain, who parried it. The latter cast
his sword at his opponent, but without effect; then each threw his
shield at the other’s legs with a view of causing him to stumble, and
the fight at close quarters with axes began. After some hard blows
had been exchanged Boniface dropped his axe, and Lalain struck at his
visor, in which his axe struck until the point broke. Boniface then
seized the Burgundian’s weapon and drew his dagger, hoping to stab
his opponent in the face, but Lalain with admirable <i>sang-froid</i> beat
down that weapon, and striking the visor of his opponent, slightly
penetrated one of the apertures with his axe, Boniface then drew his
sword and struck savagely at Lalain; at which stage of the combat the
duke’s bâton fell.</p>

<p>The jousting was accomplished later on, with varying fortune, though
without special features. It was at the tilt, “<i>et au milieu de la
lice avoit une toille, pour conduire les chevauz, pour les courses de
lances, qu’ils devoyent accomplir</i>.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The armour of de Lalain was provided with reinforcing pieces: “<i>Messire
Jacques de Lalain estoit armé de plusieures rondelles, l’une sur la
main, l’autre sur le coude du bras de la bride, et l’autre tenant
au gardebras, a maniére d’escu</i>,” but they were detached before the
jousting, Boniface being without them.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
The different chroniclers of such combats differ more or less in many details.</p>

<p>The position and dignity of an esquire is defined in Ashmolean MS.
162a:<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>

<p>Another of these MSS., 158ab, defines the duties and emoluments of a
king-at-arms.—The office of a Kinge at Armes. “Fyrst as nyghe as he
canne he shall take knowledge and kepe recorde of creastes cognissances
and auntient used wordes,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The principal additional or reinforcing pieces, <i>pièces d’avantage</i>,
are:—the grand-guard or main-guard, which is in two plates, the
volante-piece and the body portion, and these, though sometimes
separate, are usually riveted together. The former is adapted to the
contour of the helmet, to which it is firmly attached; while the
latter, fixed to the breastplate, conforms to the curves of the neck,
fits round the left side of the chest and left shoulder, and is flanged
over the right shoulder to protect the weak place at the armpit on
that side. The whole thus forms a double defence for that portion
of the body against which an attack was mainly directed. The term
“volante-piece,” as applied to the face piece of the grand-guard, is,
however, of doubtful authority. It is sometimes referred to in English
chronicles, though without stating what it really is. Meyrick employs
it in the sense above referred to, but Lord Dillon<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
inclines to the opinion that the term properly belongs to the two extra plates
over the forehead attachable to some helmets, and I am sure he is right. These
plates are present on jousting salades, and are called <i>Stirnplätten</i>
or <i>Stirndoppolstuck</i> (forehead-plates) by the Germans. However this
may be it is convenient to apply the term generally in use unless
quite assured of its incorrectness. The elbow-guard or pas-guard is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
reinforcement for the left elbow-joint, fastened by a pin. The manifer,
or mainfere, <i>main de fer</i>, <i>steife henze</i>, or miton-gauntlet is the
stiff, heavy jousting gauntlet for the bridle hand and forearm; the
name “manifer” is given by Meyrick to the crinet, absurdly connecting
the word with the mane of the horse. The poldermiton or <i>épaule de
mouton</i>, is a piece for the defence of the right forearm and bend,
which is further protected by the vamplate of the lance. In the course
with sharp lances, called <i>Scharfrennen</i> by the Germans, a dilge or
jousting-cuisse is employed, strapped to the saddle; and there was an
armlet for the right lower arm, used in that and some other courses.
The jousting-shields differ in form in the various courses: they will
be described in their order.</p>

<p>Catalogue No. 383 of the Wallace Collection, London, comprises a
small set of additional pieces, which from the subject and character
of enrichment (chevrons with minute pomegranates and scrolls, etched
and gilt) would appear to have belonged to a suit of armour in the
possession of the Duke of Northumberland, at Alnwick Castle, which was
acquired in Italy by Duke Algernon, about the year 1840; and it has
been freely and excellently restored.</p>

<p>When arming, the additional pieces were screwed on one after the other,
the jousting-shield being adjusted last. This process completed, the
jouster was almost immune from injury and was left almost an automaton,
with little power of initiative beyond aiming his lance, and that with
difficulty.</p>

<p>Jacques de Lalain sent a challenge to a feat of arms in the year 1448
to James, brother to Earl Douglas; the fight to take place in Edinburgh
in the same year. He stated the conditions of combat proposed, for a
foot encounter, <i>à outrance</i>, with spear, battle-axe, sword and dagger,
which conditions were accepted by Douglas, with the reservation, at
the instance of the King of Scotland, that no lance-casting should
be allowed. The Burgundian party consisted of Jacques and his uncle
Simon de Lalain, and a Messire de Mériadacq; while a Scottish trio,
the brothers Douglas and a Lord de Haguet, arranged to fight them: the
King to act as umpire. After some initial misunderstanding the knights
fought paired against one another as follows:—Haguet against Simon de
Lalain, Jacques against James Douglas, and Mériadacq against the other
Douglas. The chronicler describes the course of the encounter, going
into much detail, from which one would imagine that there was deadly
peril to life and limb, but no serious hurt was sustained by any of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
combatants; that fact being that the armour of proof enclosed each
of the fighters in an almost impregnable fortress. La Marche was not
present at this fight, but got his information from hearsay. Two out
of the Burgundian trio were Chevaliers (Knights), the third combatant
an Escuyer (Esquire), and it is interesting to note the difference
in costume between the two grades. Matthieu de Couci gives it in the
following terms<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>:—Chevaliers
“furent revêtus de longues robes de velours noir, fourrées de martes
zibelines fort riches”; quant au troisième qui étoit seulement Escuyer,
“il en avoit une seulement de satin noir fourrée comme les autres.”
King René says the stuff of an esquire’s costume at his court should be
“drap de damas,” and it would appear generally that an esquire could
wear either satin or damask, but the chevalier must be clad in velvet.
Further regulations were made in 1486, when cloth of gold and cloth of
silver came in.</p>

<p>The armour of the fifteenth century up to almost its close is usually
termed “Gothic,” an incongruous appellation, though one convenient to
employ owing to its having been so generally adopted and understood.
Beyond a few fragments there is no armour of the first half of the
century left to us; and for our knowledge of the knightly body-harness
of that period we are mainly indebted to an ample series of monumental
effigies and brasses. Though one cannot draw any decided line, it
may be said that the process of transition from chain-mail to plate
armour had been practically completed at the commencement of the
fifteenth century; and the progress made in the directions of elegance,
comprehensiveness and strength had been steady and continuous until
towards the middle of the century, when we have glorious complete suits
of armour spread out before us.</p>

<p>The brass of Sir John Wylcotes, in Great Tew Church, Oxfordshire,
dating about 1410, affords an example of the standard of mail, which
was a collar worn under a gorget of plate. The figure is without jupon,
so that the breastplate and taces are exposed to view, and they are of
plate; small motons, oval in form, cover the weak places at the armpits.</p>

<p>The brass in South Kelsey Church, Lincolnshire, dated about a decade
later, shows the armour to be much more ornate, having crescent-shaped
motons, fan-formed wings to the coudes; taces of six lames and short
tuilles; the figure wears a pointed bascinet. The armour on the effigy
in Hoveringham Church, Nottinghamshire, believed to have been ascribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
by Stothart to Sir Robert Grushill, is certainly not of the reign of
Richard II, 1377-1399, but should rather be dated in that of Henry VI.
There are fluted motons over the armpits, of a curved tooth-like form;
coudes with elaborate heart-shaped wings; taces of eight narrow lames,
with short rectangular tuilles, attached to the bottom rims by straps
and buckles. The helmet is still the bascinet. This effigy exhibits an
instance of the presence of the collar SS. There is an example of this
collar in the Tower of London.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
It was found in one of the turrets of the White Tower in
1913.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
It is beyond the province of this work to discuss the probable meaning
of these ciphers, which is obscure.</p>

<p>The Gothic armour of the connoisseur is reached in the beautiful effigy
of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in St. Mary’s Church, Warwick.
It is cast in laton, a golden looking blend something between bronze
and brass. The earl died in 1439, but the contract for his monument was
not given out until fifteen years after, so that the type of armour
is later than that of any actual harness worn by the earl. The effigy
exhibits body-armour at its very best, as well in dignity of form as in
beauty of outline; and if it was not directly copied from a suit made
by Tomaso Missaglai of Milan, the design for it certainly came from
Italy. The breastplate exhibits a deep curved groove on either side; it
is shorter than was usual somewhat later, with a large number of taces;
and there are low neck-guards. Mr. Stothart also gives a back view of
the figure, showing the armour as completely delineated behind as in
front. The effigy is depicted on <a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II</a>, giving
both a front view and one in profile.</p>

<p>The great armour-smiths of the fifteenth century were fine artists in
steel, and many of their creations preserved are models for all time
in elegance of form and excellence of workmanship. One can trace their
individuality and idiosyncrasies to an extent making it often possible
to attribute their work even when unstamped with their monograms and
devices. The Missaglias Negrolis and Piccininos of Milan, the Kolmans
of Augsburg, the Seusenhofers of Innsbruck, the Grünewalts and Von
Worms of Nuremberg, and many others, carried on their craft from
generation to generation.</p>

During the fifteenth century and somewhat later, new modes in armour,
as well as in dress, had their birth in Italy; but they took some time
to travel to other countries less advanced in fashion and refinement.
Much artistic skill of the highest order was lavished on the enrichment
of armour. Suits were delicately chased, engraved and decorated with
repoussé work; and artists of the highest celerity were engaged in such
work. The trapper of mixed mail and plate appears frequently in this century.</p>

<p>A very important paper, printed in <i>Archæologia</i>, LVII, by Viscount
Dillon, <span class="smcap">p.s.a.</span>, read in 1899, deals with a MS. Collection
of Ordinances of Chivalry of the fifteenth century belonging to Lord
Hastings, which contains among other matters:—</p>

<span class="i4">“The comyng into the felde.”</span>
<span class="i4">“To arme a man.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The same manuscript is also commented on by the late Mr. Albert Way
in the <i>Archæological Journal</i> of 1847.</p>

<p>Two of the illuminations depict jousting at the tilt, and another a
combat on foot with axes before King Henry VI. The fight on foot,
which took place in 1442, is between John Astley and Philip Boyle
of Arragon. The lists, enclosed by an open railing, have at one end
a stand for the king, who acted as judge, and four steps lead up to
the tribune. On either side of the steps two men-at-arms are posted,
holding long-shafted axes, and within the lists a herald is standing
watching the fight. The combatants are wearing globose bascinets, which
were the usual helmets for foot-fighting. They were roomy enough for
plenty of padding against heavy blows from the axe. Boyle is armed with
an axe having a blade on one side and a <i>bec de faucon</i>, or flook, on
the other; while Astley’s weapon has a <i>mail</i>, or mallet, with three
prongs, in place of the flook.</p>

<p>The terms of Sir Philip Boyle’s acceptance of the challenge are given
in Lord Dillon’s paper.</p>

<p>The first illumination of a joust at the tilt pictures the moment when
the tilters have shivered their lances, tipped with coronals of three
prongs, on each other’s bodies. The tilt is composed of six planks, and
appears to be between five and six feet in height. Sir John Astley’s
crest is seen to be a crowned harpy, with torse and mantling; his
armour, the sort termed “tonlet”; the legs and feet are unarmed, being
sufficiently protected by the saddle-steels. The horse is trapped and
has a chamfron. But little of the person of his adversary can be seen;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
what there is show his crest, three maidens in a corb, and he also is
wearing bases. Both riders have tilting helms and shields, and bear
poldermitons on their lance-arms. The vamplates are somewhat conical
in form.</p>

<p>The other joust pictured is that between Astley and Pierre de Masse,
which took place in a street in Paris in the year 1438. It is also
at the tilt. The date is an early one for that form of joust, if the
drawing be contemporary, which is unlikely. The tilt is composed of
four planks, and is rather lower than the other example. The jousters
wear no crests on their helms, and they are running with sharp
lances. There are no poldermitons worn in this case. This important
illumination has suffered much from damp, the central figures more
especially.</p>

<p>The articles of combat are given in Lord Dillon’s paper.</p>

<p>The “Abilment for the Justus of the Pees,” as reproduced from the
manuscript belonging to Lord Hastings, is as follows:—</p>

<p>This equipment is for a mounted contest, and differs of course
materially from that worn in fighting on foot.</p>

<p>The writer of the paper (Lord Dillon) explains such of the terms
employed as are not fairly obvious. Viscount Dillon’s researches are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
mainly embodied in a series of valuable contributions to the pages of
<i>Archæologia</i> and the <i>Archæological Journal</i>. Many old records,
which had not been seen by such excellent authorities as Meyrick and Hewitt,
have been examined and compared since their day, and they throw much
light on points and terms which were obscure until recently, and which
had been misunderstood by the earlier writers to whom we owe so much.</p>

<p>The “peyre of platus” is the cuirass, consisting of the breast and back
plates: the “Gyders,” attachments of some kind. The “hanscement” is a
close-fitting garment, worn beneath the armour. A “botton wt a tresse
in the platis,” probably also refers to fastenings or attachments of
some kind. The “Rerebrace wt a rolle of ledyr well stuffid” is probably
a padding protection for the left upper-arm. The “Maynfere with a
ring” is the manifer or mainfaire (main de fer), described in this
work under the heading of reinforcing pieces. The “rerebrase a moton”
is the rerebrace of the right arm, with its small movable plate, the
moton or besaguè over the armpit. The “vambrase and gaynpayn and ij
brickettss,” are the further defences for the right arm and hand. The
“ij dosyn tresses” are arming points, laces for attaching various parts
of the armour together. The “vamplates,” “Grapers,” and “Cornallis” are
the furniture of the lances, in their order, the conical or circular
steel hand-guards, metal rings with points which stick into the wooden
blocks in the lance-rests; the coronals, heads of the lance with blunt
points, calculated to catch on to the armour but not to pierce it.
The “bycorne” was the anvil. Illustrations of Grapers, later termed
<i>burres</i>, are rare. They are present on the illumination of the joust
at the tilt between John Astley and Pierre de Masse, being shown on a
lance standing ready for use when required. They are for distributing
the force of the shock on impact over the whole body and especially
to lessen the pressure on the wrist; and are placed towards the lower
end of the lance, the space between the graper and the vamplate
constituting the grip.</p>

<p>The rest of the “Abilment” applies to horse furniture.

<p>The <i>Pas de la Pélerine</i>, held by the Seigneur de Haubourdin Bastard
de St. Pol, and the feat of arms performed between Jacques de Lalain and
an Englishman named Thomas, both took place near St. Omer, before the
Duke of Burgundy and the Comte de Charolais, in the year 1446. Jehan,
Seigneur de Haubourdin, and six others, calling themselves <i>pélerins</i>
(pilgrims), were to hold the <i>pas</i> for six weeks against all comers.
The meeting had been proclaimed in the neighbouring countries; but,
owing to national animosities and other causes prevailing at the time,
only a single cavalier, and he a German fifty years old, attended
from abroad to contest the <i>pas</i>. Great preparations had been made:
lists prepared and a tribune, built of stone, erected for the judge.
Two shields were hung in the lists, one representing Sir Lancelot of
the Lake, the other Tristan de Leonnois. The German cavalier touched
the shield of Sir Lancelot, and was given leave to do his devoir in
accordance with the <i>chapitres d’armes</i> drawn up for the occasion. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
duke took his seat on the tribune on the day of combat at 9 a.m., and
soon afterwards the fight with axes began between the German and the
Sire de Haubourdin, who appeared as Sir Lancelot. The German, a tall
man-at-arms, though well up in years, was still vigorous, but not very
expert at the use of the axe. The number of strokes stipulated in the
articles having been exchanged, without injury to either party, the
duke cast his bâton. No other foreign venant presented himself, to the
great disappointment of all concerned. A knight, Bernard de Bearne,
Bastard de Foix, had been on his way to contest the <i>pas</i>, but had
been struck down with fever and could not be present in time.</p>

<p>In the combat on foot between Jacques de Lalain and the Englishman
named Thomas, Lalain fought in light armour, wearing a salade (<i>sallade
de guerre toute ronde</i>), leaving his face exposed; while the Englishman
wore heavy armour, his helmet being a visored bascinet. Lalain was
armed with a long-shafted axe, with spikes at the top and bottom,
having on one side a <i>bec de faucon</i>, or flook, and on the other a
mallet (<i>mail rond</i>) with three prongs. The Englishman’s weapon had
an axe-blade on one side, a hammer-head (<i>long mail</i>) on the other,
and spikes top and bottom; it had also a roundel guard. After several
strokes had been exchanged Lalain was wounded on the wrist, in spite of
which the fight continued unabated. Thomas then struck some heavy blows
at his adversary, who stepped suddenly back, so that the Englishman
lost his balance and fell heavily to the ground. This ended the fight.</p>

<p>Bernard de Bearne, Bastard de Foix, on recovering from his attack of
fever, presented himself at Bruges, ready to fulfil his engagement at
the <i>Pas de la Pélerine</i>; but as the time arranged for the course of
that meeting had expired, the <i>chapitres d’armes</i> prepared for it had
ceased to operate. Nevertheless, a combat took place at Bruges with de
Haubourdin, and new articles provided that lances were to be cast, and
then a fight with axes, until one or the other had lost his weapon. On
the day appointed for the duel the Bastard de Foix entered the lists,
in full armour, the back of his jupon embroidered with the family
arms, with the addition of the bâton of illegitimacy. Having paid his
respects to the duke, who acted as umpire, he retired to his pavilion.
De Haubourdin came and went in like manner, his jupon bearing the
cognizance of Sir Lancelot. The champions then re-entered the lists for
battle, both armed with <i>becs de faucon</i>, when it was observed that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
weapon of de Bearne was garnished with a long, slender spike,
calculated for easy penetration between the bars of the visor. De
Haubourdin on seeing this had his visor removed, saying that he would
save his adversary the trouble of piercing it. The combatants each
carried a lance in the right hand, an axe and shield in the left. The
fight commenced by the parties hurling their lances at each other; that
of de Haubourdin missed his opponent, but de Bearne’s weapon struck
the shield of his adversary, and glancing off wounded him in the arm.
Hurling their shields at each other, the champions then closed, and
after some heavy strokes had been delivered the duke’s bâton fell.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>De La Marche thus describes a feat of arms which took place on foot and
on horseback between the Seigneur Philippe de Ternant, a Chevalier de
la Toison d’Or, against Galiot de Baltasin, an esquire and chamberlain
to the Duke of Milan, in April, 1446.</p>

<p>Lists of strong planks, with a double enceinte, had been erected in
a large square in the town of Arras, near the Hostelerie de la Clef.
They were spacious in extent, and within them handsome pavilions had
been pitched for the use of the combatants, and there were gaily
decorated stands for the use of the officials and spectators. On the
day appointed Duke Philip of Burgundy took his seat on the tribune on
the stand overlooking the lists, and with him were his son, the Comte
de Charolais, and his nephew, Adolph de Cléves. On the first day of
the fighting the Seigneur de Ternant entered the lists on horseback,
armed at all points, accompanied by the Seigneur de Beaujeu and the
Comte de Sainct Pol, who acted as his esquires. Dismounting, he paid
his respects to his master the duke, after which he retired to his
pavilion. His adversary entered the lists soon after in like manner,
supported by the Comte d’Étampes, who presented him to the duke. Eight
men-at-arms, holding bâtons in their hands, were posted in the lists in
order to be ready to separate the combatants when necessary and to carry
out the orders of the duke.</p>

<p>The usual preliminaries having been gone through, each knight made the
sign of the cross and the first encounter commenced, which was a combat
on foot with lances. Baltasin attacked his adversary with such force as
to break the point of his lance; while de Ternant holed the bascinet
of his opponent. The rule as to following up would seem to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
infringed by Baltasin, for the king of arms now measured the ground
with cords and marked the limits of advance and retirement, seven paces
each way. New lances were issued, and in the next round both weapons
were broken; after which the seven thrusts provided for in the articles
were duly and gallantly accomplished. The next fight was with estocs
and, after some heavy thrusting, the limits of advance and retreat
were again marked, this time five paces each way. On the resumption of
the fight, which is described as terrible, Baltasin’s helmet was again
holed, pieces of armour was shed on both sides and gauntlets broken.
Baltasin then struck de Ternant on the lower end of the right pauldron,
forcing off the coude, and the combatants assailed each other with such
violence that the points of their estocs were broken off and others had
to be supplied. At length the eleven thrusts were duly and gallantly
performed and the combatants retired to their pavilions.</p>

<p>Then came the fight with hammer-headed axes, the heads having three
prongs, <i>la mail à maniére de trois coings à fendre bois, point
de poincte de dessous</i>; and the fifteen strokes provided for were
duly accomplished. The champions were then led before the duke, who
complimented them on their prowess.</p>

<p>After an interval of a few days the combat on horseback took place.
On the chamfron of the Italian’s horse was a long spike, which was
disallowed by the umpire, and the piece was replaced by another.
De Ternant laid his lance in rest, and his sword was at his belt;
while the Italian held his lance with the right hand, his sword and
the bridle with his left. In the first course De Baltasin evaded
impact with the lance, but spurred his charger at de Ternant’s horse,
apparently with the object of unseating its rider. The Burgundian,
however, kept the saddle, and after some further fighting the combat
ended without hurt to either party. The action by the Italian was a
contravention of one of the laws of the tourney, but it was passed over
by the umpire without remark.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The first joust of the Comte de Charolais, afterwards Charles the Bold,
then in his eighteenth year, was run in the park at Brussels in 1452.
His father, Duke Philip, selected the redoubted champion Jacques de
Lalain as the first adversary; and a grand tournament was proclaimed to
take place in Brussels soon after. In the trial course the Comte and
Lalain charged each other, the former breaking his lance on the shield
of his opponent, but Lalain passed without touching him with his lance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The duke was much displeased at this, and ordered that in the course
next following there should be absolute equality between the parties;
and on the signal being given they charged, each knight breaking his
lance fairly and well on the other’s body. This time it was the duchess
who was angry with Lalain, for his dangerous assault on her son. On
the day of the tournament at Brussels in the same year the Comte de
Charolais played his part manfully and well, and in the evening he was
awarded the first prize by the ladies. In the <i>conte des finances</i> of
1452 there is an item for 360 livres for his outfit.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
The tournament had been proclaimed throughout the countries of chivalry, and
was held in honour of the eighteenth birthday of the Comte de Charolais, in
the Rathhausplatz of the city. Five challengers held the field against
all comers. Charles ran in eighteen courses, his adversaries being,
Adolph de Cléves, Seigneur de Ravastain; Wolfart de Borssele; the Earl
of Buchan; Messire de Vere; Jean de la Tremoille; Charles de Ternant;
Jacques de Lalain; and the Seigneur de Bugnicourt.</p>

<p>The jousting was followed by the quintain, and by a combat on foot.
The meeting concluded with the <i>mêlée</i>, after which the prizes were
presented. It was this <i>pas d’armes</i> that was selected for reproduction
at Brussels in 1905.</p>

<p>Jousting was now frequently combined with masques, mummeries and
pageants. The Duke of Cléves was on a visit to his uncle Philip, Duke
of Burgundy, in 1453; and a series of fêtes was held at Lille in his
honour. During the inaugural banquet a beautiful girl entered the
hall bearing a chaplet of flowers, with which she gracefully crowned
the duke; and it seems that this was the sign that the entertainment
immediately following would be given by him. This duly began on the
morrow, an hour after noon, when a knight of the distinguished order
of the swan issued from the palace, fully armed. It was the Duke of
Cléves who was to hold a joust in the market-place at Lille that day;
he, the tenant, against all comers, being ready to break a lance with
all venans who presented themselves for combat. He was preceded by the
figure of a gigantic swan, of the size of a horse; the bird, on each
side of which marched a savage in his war-paint, led the knight along
by a chain of gold. The knight was encircled by little angels, and was
followed by the duke, who was magnificently dressed. The procession
thus formed marched to the lists, where the knight of the swan tilted
with the Comte de Charolais, the Comte de St. Pol, Sir Anthony, Bastard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of Burgundy, and many others. After the jousting was done the duke
escorted the ladies to the palace, where a banquet was served. The hall
was gorgeously decorated. Facing the upper table a fountain played, and
there was a live lion in the hall. After the company had taken their
seats a holy friar advanced and addressed the duke, urging him to lead
his armies against the infidel; and his grace swore that if the King
of France would engage to leave his dominions in peace he was ready to
march with his entire forces in defence of Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>A tournament was held on the coronation of King Edward IV, at which the
ring and ruby were won by Lord Stanley.</p>

<p>The following account is given in <i>Mémoires de la Marche</i><a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
of the <i>pas d’armes</i> held by King Edward IV of England in the year 1467,
at West Smithfield, in which the Bastard of Burgundy took a leading part.
The narration is here much condensed. King Edward had caused lists
of unusual magnificence to be prepared for the occasion, and costly
galleries were erected at the sides. The stand for the accommodation of
the king and his court, his knights and others, was in three stories,
a flight of steps leading up to the umpire’s tribune. The knights
occupied the first story; the esquires, the second; and in the third
were posted the royal archers of the guard. The second erection, lower
than the other, was occupied by the mayor and aldermen of London,
the judges, and other persons in authority: and pavilions, richly
decorated, were pitched for the use of the combatants. In due time the
king ascended the steps of the tribune, preceded by his sword-bearer,
an earl; his majesty was clad in a purple robe and wore the insignia
of the order of the garter; and in attendance was a score or more of
his counsellors. Chairs were provided for the constable and marshal,
and the king took his seat on the tribune as judge. The constable’s
guard of eight men-at-arms then entered the lists and took up their
positions, when a knocking was heard at the gate. It was a knight who
knocked, and the constable asked to know his purpose. “My name,” said
the knight, “is Escallis,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
and I am come to accomplish a deed of arms with the Bastard of
Burgundy, and demand entrance into the lists to do my <i>devoir</i>.”
Permission having been accorded, the knight entered the lists in full
armour, and was followed by ten or a dozen horses, richly caparisoned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
led by pages; and after making his obeisance to the sovereign he
retired to his pavilion. The Bastard of Burgundy then entered the
lists in a like manner, accompanied by the Duke of Suffolk, who had
been deputed by the king to attend him; and in his train were twelve
horses, trapped in cloth of gold and velvet, with the arms of Burgundy
and the bâton of illegitimacy embroidered upon them. After paying his
compliments to the king he also retired to his pavilion. Both knights
re-entered the lists for battle, their lances were handed to them, and
they took up positions for their careers. The onset being sounded they
placed their lances in rest and charged towards each other, meeting in
the centre of the lists, without injury to either party; then drawing
their swords they attacked each other with great fury. Lord Scales,
spurring up his horse, dashed violently against that of his adversary,
the shock of the collision bearing the Burgundian and his charger
to the ground, where the Bastard lay with his horse upon him. The
officials of the lists raised up the fallen champion, when it was found
that he had not sustained any serious injury. The king was annoyed at
this incident; Lord Scales, however, pleaded that it was the freshness
of his horse which had caused the accident. This put an end to the
fighting for the day, and the Bastard retired to his lodgings, where
he was afterwards visited by the constable with a message of sympathy
and enquiry from the king, and an expression of regret at the accident.
“Thank the king,” replied the bastard, “and tell him that to-day I have
fought with a beast, but to-morrow I will engage a man.”</p>

<p>The champions joined in a combat on foot the next day, with spears,
axes and daggers, the fight to continue until one or other should be
disarmed or borne to the ground. It had been arranged that spears
should be cast, but on the king objecting that part of the proceedings
was omitted. The fight then began. Lord Scales dealt the Bastard some
heavy strokes with his axe, and the Bastard, attacking with great
violence, seriously fractured the armour of his adversary, at which
stage of the combat the king cast his bâton.</p>

<p>De la Marche was present at the fight.</p>

<p>Other contests took place on the following day; but on intelligence
arriving of the death of Duke Philippe le Bon, of Burgundy, the meeting
broke up.</p>

<p>Monstrelet states that the lists were 370 feet long by 250 feet broad,
and gives a somewhat different account of the mounted combat. He says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that the jousting was with pointed lances, and further that the
chamfron of the horse of Lord Scales was garnished with a long steel
spike, which, being thrust into the mouth of the Bastard’s charger,
caused the animal such pain that it reared and at length fell, with its
rider, the Burgundian, underneath.</p>

<p>Holinshed’s version<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
is as follows:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“The first daie they ran togither diurse courses
with sharpe speares, and departed with equall honer. The next day they
turneied on horsseback. The lord Scales horsse had on his chafron a
long sharpe pike of steele, and as the two champions coped togither,
the same horsse (whether through custome or by chance), thrust his pike
into the nosethrils of the bastard’s horsse; so that for verie paine
he mounted so high, that he fell on the one side with his maister, and
the lord Scales rode round about him with his sword in his hand, vntill
the King commanded the marshall to helpe vp the bastard, which openlie
said ‘I cannot hold me by the clouds, for though my horse faileth me,
surelie I will not fail my counter-companion.’”</p>

<p>The king would not suffer them to do any more that day. On the morrow
the champions fought with pole-axes, when at length the point of the
axe wielded by Lord Scales was thrust into the sight of the Bastard’s
helm with such force that it brought him to his knees, on which the
king cast his bâton. The Bastard wished to fight again, but the umpire
ruled that should the encounter be continued it could only recommence
at the stage reached at the termination of the last combat, with the
Bastard on his knees. On hearing this judgment the Bastard relinquished
his challenge.</p>

<p>An Ashmolean MS. (111-3b) furnishes the following<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>:—“A
demonstracōn by John Writh alias Garter, to King Edward the Fourth, touching
three Knyghtes of high Almayn wch came to do arms in England, with the
instruccōns by them geven unto the saide Gartr and the articles of
their feates and enterprise.” The year must have been 1473.</p>

<p>The blending of the tourney with the pageant, mummeries and buffoonery
continued to gain ground, and the sumptuous and costly fêtes held at
Bruges in 1468, on the occasion of the marriage of Charles of Burgundy
with Margaret of York, sister to King Edward IV of England, afford an
excellent example of these combinations. All is minutely described
at great length by de la Marche.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
He gives details of the dresses, ceremonial and armour, and full
particulars of each joust; he also names the historic personages taking
part. The plot of the leading pageant, if it can be called a plot, is
inconsequent, though staged with great splendour and elaboration. There
were tableaux of the Twelve Labours of Hercules, and many allegorical
representations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Lists were erected in the Grande Place, and just within them stood
<i>l’arbre d’or</i>, a great fir-tree, the trunk of which was gilded over,
and it was this tree which lent its name to the fête. The Bastard of
Burgundy and Adolf de Cléves, Seigneur de Ravastain, cousin-german to
the duke, assumed the rôle of Chevaliers de L’Arbre d’Or, and they were
to hold the <i>pas</i> in its defence. The fêtes were arranged to extend
over ten days. On the first day the duke took his seat on the tribune,
and a “poursuivant-at-armes,” clad in the livery of <i>l’arbre d’or</i>,
handed him a letter from the princess of an unknown isle, in which she
proffers her favour to any knight who would deliver a certain giant
from captivity, whom she had placed under the guardianship of her
dwarf. The dwarf, gaily dressed in crimson and white satin, now entered
the arena, leading in the giant by a chain, and, binding him to the
golden tree, took up a position on a flight of steps, with a trumpet
and sand-glass in his hands. The dwarf then sounded a note on his
trumpet, and turned the sand-glass, which was timed for half an hour,
at the expiration of which Adolf de Cléves, as Chevalier de L’Arbre
d’Or, who was to open the <i>pas</i>, knocked at the gate of the lists,
and the pursuivant demanded his name and errand. “I am come,” said
he, “to accomplish the adventure of the giant, and demand admission.”
The blazon of his arms having been submitted to the judge it was hung
suspended on the tree, and the dwarf admitted him. De Ravastain was
borne into the lists in a litter, carried on the backs of two black
horses, and made a brilliant entrance with his team of drummers and
trumpeters on the march; his robe was of velvet, the colour of leather,
trimmed with ermine, and on his head was a cardinal’s hat. His handsome
charger, richly caparisoned, bore a pair of panniers on his back,
between which a court fool was seated, and it followed the litter, led
by a varlet. The duchess was seated on her tribune, and the chevalier,
throwing away his hat, knelt down before her and set forth the details
of the rôle he had assumed, praying for her permission to carry out
his plan. This being graciously accorded, he retired to his pavilion
to arm him, re-entering the lists on horseback. The dwarf then gave
the signal for the jousting, and the venans, sumptuously arrayed and
brilliantly attended, were successively disposed of. After they had
been dealt with, the dwarf again blew his trumpet and the prize was
presented to de Cléves. The cavaliers then jousted each with a <i>gros
planchon blanc</i>, but without touching each other; and the first day’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
proceedings finished with a banquet. Jousts of different kinds, dinners
and entertainments continued over each succeeding day of the fêtes.
On the sixth day the Bastard of Burgundy had his leg nearly broken;
on the eighth the Sire Philippe de Poictiers was wounded; and on the
ninth day Duke Charles jousted with his kinsman, de Ravastain, breaking
eight spears to eleven by his opponent. The prize was a <i>destrier</i>,
richly accoutred, provided with panniers, and in them was an entire
jousting equipment of the Bastard of Burgundy. The prize was won by the
Sire de Arguel, who had broken thirteen lances on the third day of the
fêtes. In keeping account of the splintered lances, the <i>articles du
pas</i> determine how they shall be broken:—“<i>car nulles lances ne furent
tenues pour rompues, s’il n’y avoit quatre doigts de franc au-dessous
du roquet, ou devant la grape</i>.” The lances for every contest were always
carefully measured before being used, so that they were of equal length.</p>

<p>The lists were cleared of the tilt and stands, and the <i>mêlée</i>
began, there being twenty-five cavaliers on each side. They fought with
rebated swords, and with such ardour that all signals to stop were
disregarded, and it was only when the duke rode in among them unhelmed,
sword in hand, that they could be induced to cease fighting and go and
prepare for the banquet which was to follow.</p>

<p>Philip de Commenes was present and tilted with Jerom of Cambrai. The
banquet was served on a splendid scale, and the side tables were
curiously embellished. On one of the dishes was the figure of a unicorn
the size of a horse, with a leopard on his back waving the banner of
England in one hand, and holding in the other a <i>fleur de marguerite</i>.
The unicorn was trapped in silk, on which were embroidered the arms of
England. A <i>fleur de marguerite</i> was presented to the duke by the hand
of a little female dwarf belonging to Marie of Burgundy. The dwarf was
dressed as a shepherdess, in cloth of gold, and was mounted on a huge
lion, bearing the arms of Burgundy, which opened its mouth by means of
springs, and chanted a poem in honour of the beautiful shepherdess.
There were many more mechanical contrivances; and on the last day
of the fêtes a whale sixty feet long entered the hall, escorted by
two giants. The whale wagged its tail and fins; its eyes were great
mirrors, and when it opened its mouth sirens issued from it, chanting
most melodiously. After further conceits the two giants were swallowed
by the whale.</p>

<p>A copy of a very quaint manuscript, portions of it written at different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
times in the reign of Edward IV and up to that of Henry VIII, is given
in <i>Archæologia</i> of the year 1846. It describes the marriage ceremony
and the pageants, remarking as to the latter:—“the pageantes wear so
obscure, that I fere me to writ or speke of them, because all was
cuntenaunce and no wordes.”</p>

<p>As to the excitement of the <i>mêlée</i> and the disregard of the signals
and commands to cease fighting, the MS. says:—“the Duke unhelmed
hyme, and with a great staffe his person charged pece in paine of deth,
and soe wt great labore he droffe the parties asounder.”</p>

<p>There was not much tourneying at the court of Burgundy after this,
for Duke Charles was too busily and constantly engaged in military
enterprises against his neighbours; and, indeed, his ambitious, predatory
and headstrong career was fast drawing to a close, ending, in fact, in
1477 on the fatal field of Nancy. The jousting traditions of his house
passed over through his daughter, his only child, to the Austrian and
German courts, under Maximilian: and it is to these countries, more
especially, to which we must now turn for the history of the tournament
in its decline.</p>

<p>In the same year as the fêtes at Bruges, 1468, a joust was held in
front of the king’s hotel at the Tournelles, Paris; the challengers against
all comers being four gentlemen of the company of the Seneschal of
Normandy. John Raquier hastened from Rouen to take part, and he
broke five lances with distinction; then came Marc Senamy and two
sons of Sir John Sanguin, who all acquitted themselves well, after whom
Charles de Louviers, cup-bearer to the king, jousted successfully, and the
prize of the day was adjuged to him. After all these encounters the
tenans were much bruised, two of them carried their arms in slings and
a third was severely wounded in the hand; so that the honours of the
meeting lay with the venans.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

A superb representation on tapestry of a <i>mêlée</i> which took place late
in the fifteenth century, worked at Malines, is now at Valenciennes;
and it is remarkable for its technical accuracy. The jousting is over;
and a combat with sharp swords in progress. Broken lances, a helmet, a
broken helm, fragments of crests, <i>grelots</i> and other debris shed in
the contest lie on the ground among the horse’s hoofs. The helmets are
armets of the older form, of which there are existing examples spread
over the collections of Europe. This type has hinged side-pieces and
opens out from the middle for inserting and withdrawing the head of
the wearer; and it is fastened together with a leathern strap. There
is a small circular disk projecting from the back of the helmet,
as well as a collar in front and over the neck behind, to which a
necklet of chain-mail is fixed by a line of rivets. The comb of the
helmet is holed for the attachment of a crest and the visor projects
in a sort of beak. The disk is fixed to one side of the back of the
head-piece by a thin iron connecting pin or bar. Its use or purpose
is difficult to imagine and has given rise to much controversy, but
none of the explanations advanced are at all convincing, for the bar
or connecting pin is too slender to protect the neck from a sword
stroke or even to shield from injury the strap at the back which holds
the helmet together. This type fell into disuse at the commencement
of the sixteenth century. The armour shown on the figures is fairly
uniform. A long mail shirt with sleeves is worn, and it is much less
covered with plate than might be expected at the end of the fifteenth
century. The forms of the pauldrons, neck-guards, globose breastplate,
“bear-paw,” or “cow-mouth” sollerets (as they were called), tuilles,
tassets, and bases all mark the period, which other historic features
on the tapestry confirm. Motons appear on only one of the figures, and
they are pear-shaped; in the case of the other front figures there is
no defence for the armpits beyond the chain-mail shirt. The lances are
both grooved and plain, the vamplates, circular. An unusual feature
is the presence of three long, narrow, label-shaped plates or bars,
ridged down the middle, with small circular eyes at the tops, through
which screws or rivets are passed, attaching them to the back rim of
the armet. The back-plates are low, reaching but half-way up, and these
three plates or bars form the only defence for the upper back outside
the mail shirts. They appear to be adjustable to a certain extent. The
middle plate is the longest of the three, extending down the spine of
the wearer to over the top of the low back-plate; while the side-bars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
equal in length, reach well over the pauldron wings. The horses are all
barded in leather, with chamfrons and crinets apparently of iron; and
none of the animals are trapped. The bridles are of chain-mail, framed
in iron. The tapestry measures 4·70 m. to 5·60 m. in size, and part of
it is shown on <a href="#PLATE_I_2">Plate I (2)</a>.</p>

<p>In the year 1487 Johannes, Duke of Saxony, ran in <i>Gestech</i> with Cuntz
Metzschen at Jena, and both riders kept their seats. They wore armour
such as described in <a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate IX (1)</a>: the motons were very
ornate. On the duke’s helm were two small black flags, on which the letter “M” was
embroidered, in honour of his wife, Sophie of Mecklenburg. His trapper
and shield were black, with violet, yellow, and white stripes.</p>

<p>A “Solemne Triumphe” was held at Richmond, which lasted a whole month,
at which Sir James Parker was killed, in 1494.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The two most important armouries are those at Vienna and Madrid; but
for the study of the tourney that at Dresden is the best. Indeed, much
of the armour there has remained, practically <i>in situ</i>, since it was
in use, and many of the harnesses can be attributed with certainty,
both as regards wearers and makers. In the <i>Tournierwaffensaal</i>
several of the mounted models have sat their horses since the year
1591. At Dresden may be seen examples of the saddles, horse muzzles,
weapons, bards and trappers; and even the textile costumes worn over
and under the armour, as well as the small accessories and tools, may
be studied. Besides these armouries, those at Paris, Berlin, Turin,
Nuremberg, the Tower of London, and the Wallace Collection, are large
and comprehensive.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Much</span>
that is fanciful and unreal has been written about the tournament,
and it is only in recent times that the knowledge of the subject
has been placed on a more scientific basis, through the labours and
researches of Querin von Leitner, Cornelius Curlitt, Boeheim, Dillon,
Haenel and others, who have built on the valuable foundations laid by
earlier writers on the subject. In France the subject has received but
scant attention in recent times.</p>

<p>The contemporary literature in France and England concerning the
tournament of the sixteenth century is much less voluminous than that
written in the fifteenth, and the narrations of chroniclers greatly
lack that technical knowledge which characterizes the work of their
predecessors, who belonged to a higher class of society. The contrast,
indeed, in their treatment of these meetings is very marked, in that
comparatively little attention is devoted by the later writers to the
martial sports themselves, while the pageantry and dresses closely
connected with them absorb most of the matter of their narrations.
This is perhaps an indication of a diminished public interest in
the tournament in these countries; and but for the fuller and more
circumstantial German records it would be difficult to present any
comprehensive account of its ramifications during the sixteenth century
and to the time when it fell into disuse. There are many records
relating to the tournament in the College of Arms, London, and among
the Ashmolean, Harleian and Cottonian MSS.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>;
whilst the <i>Chronicles</i> of Hall and Holinshed also afford much
information. De Pluvinal, in <i>Maneige Royal</i>, published in 1625, gives
some interesting particulars of jousting in its later stages, and
Ménestrier, in <i>Traité des Tournois, Jousts, Carrousels, &amp;c.</i>, when
it had almost ceased being practised.</p>

<p>The institution had attained its highest development in most of the
countries of chivalry in the first half of the fifteenth century, and
the sixteenth saw its rapid decline. It had become more and more a mere
sport and pastime, and had lost much of its former dignity in being so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
closely associated with mummeries and the pageant. All the safeguards
instituted in the fifteenth century had become accentuated in the
sixteenth to a degree making serious accidents very rare; and the
introduction of barriers in combats on foot, and the employment of
lances in these contests, apart from the preliminary casting, so
often described in the narrations of such encounters of the fifteenth
century, had greatly changed their character, and made them much less
dangerous.</p>

<p>In admitting cavaliers to the tournament kings of arms were particular
to exclude all who were not of noble birth, with the requisite number
of descents. The bâton of illegitimacy, however, was no bar to the
admission of the bastards of princely houses, who were generally
accepted in society on an apparently equal footing with nobles of the
highest rank.</p>

<p>The prizes awarded were often a wreath, a ring, a sword, helmet, jewel
or a charger; at a joust held at Weimar in 1534 they consisted of a
spur, a sword and a lady’s slipper, all of gold.</p>

<p>Many new forms of jousting were introduced in Germany late in the
fifteenth and during the sixteenth centuries, though most of them
were derived from three main courses with but trivial differences
from them. Some of the variants were conceived with a view to the
introduction of some striking or humorous novelty; and, in fact, the
passion for theatrical effect then prevailing in Germany, brought about
some extraordinary mechanical absurdities as applied to jousting. The
intricacies of the various courses would seem to have been somewhat
perplexing even to the generations by whom they were practised, and
they are, of course, much more difficult to disentangle now.</p>

<p>It was in Germany that the bulk of the jousting harnesses of the
sixteenth century were made, and in that country the contemporary
literature over the period in question concerning the tournament is
most considerable.</p>

<p>The tournament records of the emperor Maximilian I and those of the
ruling princes of the German Empire are of the first importance in
the history of the tournament of the period, for it was at the courts
of these sovereigns that such sports were most practised in their
various phases, and when they reached their greatest development. The
tournament, with its attendant pageants and mummeries, played a leading
part in the weekly routine of the relaxation and amusements of these
princes and their chivalry, a part perhaps second only to the chase;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and these records bring the actual details of the various courses
vividly before us in the many carefully executed drawings representing
them which have been preserved. Most of them deal with the tournament
of the sixteenth century, though some of the combats of the last
quarter of the fifteenth are recorded and illustrated; and while,
perhaps, none of the drawings are strictly speaking contemporaneous
with the events they depict many of them were copied from older
pictures, so that taken as a whole the details given are more reliable
than most of the other sources of information.</p>

<p>The most precious among these tourney-books is the <i>Freydal</i> of
Maximilian I, a work of the year 1515, in which the emperor’s combats
in the lists, with the accompanying mummeries, are pictured.</p>

<p>The allegorical name “Freydal” is one of those assumed by the emperor
in his knightly character. Maximilian was born in 1459, elected emperor
in 1494, and died in 1520. He began his jousting career when quite
a youth, and took a leading and personal part in the compilation
of <i>Freydal</i>, dictating some of the text to his secretary Max
Trytssaurwein in 1511; and, indeed, he corrected some of the proofs
with his own hand. He selected for the book the examples of the various
courses in which he was engaged, in almost all of which he appears as
the victor. These instructions as to the choice of the subjects of the
plates are of great value to the student, and are given in <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D</a>.
The personal character of the work adds much to its interest and
importance in the history of the tournament.</p>

<p>The admirable reproduction of <i>Freydal</i> by Querin von Leitner, issued
under the directions of Franz, Grafen Folliot De Grenneville,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
leaves little to be desired. There are 255 plates arranged in series of
<i>Rennen</i>, <i>Stechen</i>, foot combats and a <i>mêlée</i>, all depicting
courses in which Maximilian had “<i>gerennt</i>, <i>gestochen</i> und
<i>gekämpft</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
The work is valuable from many points of view, for it includes a register
of the prominent personages of the time, and full particulars of the
colours, trappers, arms and crests of the cavaliers taking part,
together with the costumes of the mummers and others, besides some
genealogical notes.</p>

<p><i>Freydal</i> is one of a series of chronicles somewhat similar in
character, comprising <i>Theuerdank</i>, <i>Weisskünig</i>, <i>Triumph of Maximilian</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and <i>Ehrenpforte</i>; all were written with a view to the glorification
of the emperor and his reign. <i>Freydal</i> is the emperor’s testament to
posterity of his career in the tiltyard, and, with the accompanying
mummeries he initiated, forms a knightly tribute to the memory of his
much lamented consort Mary of Burgundy. A poem in the work follows,
which illustrates the spirit of vanity and the somewhat frivolous
character of the monarch:—</p>

<p><i>Theuerdank</i> is a narration of Maximilian’s journey to Ghent to wed
the heiress of Charles the Bold, with an account of his adventures by the
way, and the story of his courtship. It was written by the emperor for
the instruction of Charles V when a youth. There are 117 wood-cuts by
Hans Schaufflein.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Weisskünig</i> is the story of his life and government.</p>

<p><i>The Triumph</i> describes the progress and achievements of his reign,
as typified by the picture of the triumphal car running through it. It
was written in 1512, greatly at the emperor’s own dictation; and the
illustrations depict jousters fully equipped for some of the various
courses of the tournament.</p>

<p><i>The Ehrenpforte</i> is a monument to the glory of the Emperor’s
name and house.</p>

<p>In the tourney-book of Maximilian belonging to the Prince of
Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen the spirited illustrations are by the hand
of Hans Burgmaier, of Augsburg, an able coadjutor of the great
armour-smith Koloman Colman of the same city, surnamed Helmschmidt.</p>

<p>Of great interest and importance are the three original tourney books
of the Saxon Electors—Johanns <i>des Beständigen</i>, Johann Friedrichs
<i>des Grozmüthigen</i>, and August, scoffingly called by Carlyle, if we
remember rightly, the <i>physically</i> strong. They are in three volumes,
which are preserved in the public library at the Japanese Palace,
Dresden. The illustrations, which number over 300, are water-colour
drawings on parchment, and they depict the courses of <i>Rennen</i>,
<i>Stechen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
and a <i>mêlée</i>, as run by those princes during their reigns; they afford
characteristic records of these knightly sports from the year 1487 to
1566. The earlier jousts of the <i>Kurfürst</i> Johann begin towards the end
of the fifteenth century, the others following in the sixteenth; while
the third volume, executed in 1584, includes fifty-five drawings of the
courses of <i>Scharfrennen</i> and <i>Gestech</i> run by the <i>Kurfürst</i>
August, the last taking place in February, 1566, at Dresden. The drawings are
by Heinrich Göding, of Brunswick, the court painter, and many of them
would seem to have been copied from an earlier work.</p>

<p>There is also an old copy of one of the books in the royal library at
Veste Coburg. Professor Haenel, the Curator of the Johanneum Collection
of Arms and Armour at Dresden, has reproduced a selection of the plates
in the three volumes of the joustings of the Saxon <i>Kurfürsts</i>, two
of them coloured as in the originals, the others plain (published under
the auspices of <i>Die Verein für historische Waffenkunde</i>, Dresden,
1910). The book supplies a long-felt want, for the original volumes are
not easy of access.

<p>In the <i>Gewehrgalerie</i> at the Johanneum, Dresden,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
are twenty-nine paintings in oils by the same artist as those in the tourney-books,
and they depict courses run in <i>Scharfrennen</i> by the <i>Kurfürsts</i>.
These pictures are of even greater value than the drawings in the
tourney-books in being painted on a larger scale, and giving more
details both of the courses themselves and the general surroundings of
the lists. One of them, like the last picture in the tournament-book,
Vol. III, depicts the last joust of the <i>Kurfürst</i> August, run against
his ennobled master-armourer Hans Dehn, in the year 1566; and it bears
the title, “<i>Ein Rennen mit Hannss Dehnen gethan, der ist alleine
gefallen. Ao 66 im Februar zu Dressten an der Festnacht</i>.” This
oil-painting is hung in a bad light, and is darkened by age, but a
close examination reveals the fact that the riders and horses are only
models, stuffed with straw, their hoofs attached to low four-wheeled
bogies. The figures are impelled to charge by a mechanical apparatus;
ropes, running along the bogies and beyond, are visible, but the
machinery itself for setting the models in motion is hidden from view.
These models, as stated on the picture, formed part of a Carnival
mummery, held at court. The painting exhibits the moment when Hans
Dehn is in the act of being hurled from his horse by the <i>Kurfürst</i>,
his lance falling to the ground; while the prince is holding up his
left hand in the manner customary after impact. The <i>Kurfürst</i> wears
a jousting-salade, with a crest of plumes; the usual shield; bases and
jousting-cuisses. The legs and feet are unarmoured. The lance is stout,
rounded, adorned with puffs, and headed with a small conically formed
sharp tip; the vamplate is very large. The horse bears an enriched
collar and a spiked chamfron, while plumes adorn the head and tail. The
saddle is without cantle, the object of the course being unhorsing; the
trapper, reaching down to the horse’s houges, is painted with stars,
foliations and the arms (viz. a lion <i>rampant</i>).</p>

About the end of the seventeenth century the models of horses used for
the display of armour in the Tower of London were mounted on casters,
and guide books of the period and later state that they had been
employed in practising tilting and running at the ring. This could
hardly have been the case as regards these particular models, their
purpose having been doubtless merely for convenience in moving and
cleaning. These statements were, however, founded on the fact that
there had been horses fitted with mechanical contrivances for impelling
them forward towards one another for the purpose of practising the
joust and its kindred military sports. In the years 1672 and 1673
patents were taken out in England for models of horses fitted with
mechanical appliances for the purpose in question,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
and the joust at Dresden on Twelfth-night, 1566, shows that they
were not confined to this country.</p>

<p>The subjects of the paintings and embroideries on trappers in the
sixteenth century were often humorous, religious, and sometimes even
political in character. An example shows a barrel of gunpowder in the
act of explosion and a pair of sweethearts standing before it kissing.
Another exhibits a man standing in the street, clad only in his shirt,
being well soused with water thrown from an open window. A religious
example deals with the struggle in progress between the propaganda of
reform as against the Church of Rome, wherein a monk and a Lutheran
divine are seen fighting for the globe amid lightning and hail; the
waves of the sea, peopled by monsters of the deep, advancing menacingly
towards them.</p>

<p>The mottoes are often curious and suggestive, for instance:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Was achte ich des Monden Schein,</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>wenn mir die Sonne gnedig sein.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Niemand weisz mein Sinn</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Ob ich ein Fuchs od Hase bin.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The humorous devices painted were sometimes groups of owls,
hares, mice or foxes. Trappers were usually armoried.</p>

<p>The contract price for a complete harness for the tiltyard in the
second half of the sixteenth century was usually from 100 to 200
<i>thalers</i> (£20 to £40), rather a wide margin; though anything extra
special in the way of enrichment would often cost much more. August
<i>Kurfürst</i> of Saxony ordered from Peffenhaüser of Augsburg in 1582 a
“<i>Stechkürass fur die Pallier</i><a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
<i>mit allen Doppelstücken, und alle Stücke zum Freirennen und
Fussturnier 200 Thalers</i>,” i.e. a harness for jousting at the tilt
with the reinforcing pieces thereto appertaining, together with the
additional pieces for <i>Freirennen</i> and <i>Fussturnier</i>. A more ordinary
suit “<i>ein anderer, schlichter, gemeiner Kürass</i>” is offered at 100
<i>thalers</i>. Four <i>thalers</i> “<i>Tringeld</i>” for each suit was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
usually added. A <i>Feldkürass</i> (a hoasting harness) was cheaper, say 60
to 80 <i>thalers</i> according to quality. Prices had advanced since the
beginning of the century. In 1511, September 16, “Conrad Seusenhofer
receives for two suits of armour for his Imperial Majesty and one for
the English Embassy 211 <i>florins</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>1512. Sept 13. “Payments made by Thomas Wuley on the King’s behalf to a
certain merchant of Florence for 2000 complete harnesses called Almayne
rivets according to pattern in the hands of John Douncy, accounting
alway a salet, a gorget, a breastplate, a back-plate and a pair of
splints for every complete harness at 16s a set.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Such last-named suits were for the soldiery and without armour for the arms and legs.</p>

<p>Hans Schwenkh’s <i>Wappenmeisterbuch</i>, the tourney-book of Duke William
IV of Bavaria, in the Royal Library at Munich, commences in 1510. It
was compiled by Frederich von Schlichtegroll in 1807, it exhibits
eight separate forms of the tourney, and covers the jousting of the
duke in the first quarter of the sixteenth century together with later
examples. The illustrations are faithfully reproduced on stone by the
brothers Theobald and Clemens Senefeder, with an explanatory text by
Schlichtegroll.</p>

<p>The tourney-book of Duke Henry of Braunschweig-Lüneburg is at Berlin;
that of the Pole Zuganoviez Stanislaus of the year 1574 in the Dresden
Historical Museum.</p>

<p>Several forms of jousting, combats on foot and the tourney prevailing
in the fifteenth century have been lightly touched upon, and a more
detailed statement of the leading courses now follows, together with an
account of their more important variants.</p>

<p>The main courses of the jousts are:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Courses run in the lists with lances rebated or
tipped with coronals, without a tilt or barrier between the jousters;
the chief object in view being the splintering of lances and
unhorsing.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Courses of courtesy run in the lists with
sharp lances, also without a tilt; the main desideratum being
unhorsing.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Courses run with lances tipped with coronals,
in which the jousters charged along a tilt which was between them. In
this course the chief object in view was the splintering of lances.</p>
</div>

<p>There are many variants in the first two groups.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>These three classes were practised more or less in all the countries of
chivalry in the sixteenth century, though outside Germany it was the
joust at the tilt which was commonly run. In the Fatherland and Austria
these courses were known respectively as the <i>Gestech</i> or <i>Stechen</i>,
<i>Scharfrennen</i> or <i>Rennen</i>, and the <i>Welsch Gestech</i> or Italian joust.</p>

<p>The type of joust run in the lists without a barrier or tilt, the
lances tipped with coronals, is a very old one, though it had been
subjected to a gradual modification and the application of safeguards
as the centuries had advanced. The horses were blindfolded, so that
they should not flinch or jib at the moment of impact, and so deflect
the aim of the rider; and the animals were also sometimes rendered deaf
by the stopping of their ears with wool, and they were often muzzled.
Except in the case of one German variant of this class, the legs of the
riders were without armour, these limbs being sufficiently protected by
the saddle-steels. A chamfron, sometimes spiked, covered the face of
the horse, and a crinet its neck. A cushion or mattress (<i>Stechkissen</i>
or <i>Bourrelet</i>), filled with straw, hung from the saddle-bow, covering
the chest of the animal, to act as a buffer when there were collisions,
which frequently happened in the absence of a tilt; and, indeed, in
such cases one or both chargers, with their riders, often fell. An
illustration of this cushion is given in the <i>Tourney Book of René
d’Anjou</i>, and another by Boeheim in his <i>Waffenkunde</i>, drawn after
an actual example, which is believed to have belonged to Maximilian I, and
now forms part of the superb collection of arms and armour at Vienna.
The horse was usually barded in leather, which did not extend to the
front, and a trapper, painted with various devices, covered its body.
The saddle employed in Class 1, which weighs about 10·2 <i>kilos.</i>, has
a high squared plate in front reaching to the jouster’s breast, and there
are short steels, though no cantle; so that unhorsing was of frequent
occurrence. The head-piece of this class was the great jousting-helm.
This course involved much more skill and initiative in the jouster and
a more careful training of the horse than did the joust at the tilt.
This class of joust was much practised in Germany under the general
name “<i>Gestech</i>” or its abbreviation “<i>Stechen</i>,” and was
in three forms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">(a) <i>Das Gestech im hohen Zeug</i> or
<i>Hohenzeuggestech</i>, known in France as <i>Joûte à la haute barde</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(b) <i>Das gemeine deutsche Gestech.</i> <i>La Joûte
Allemand.</i></p>

<p class="neg-indent">(c) <i>Das Gestech im Beinharnisch.</i> <i>Joûte au
harnois de jambe.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
The joust in Germany was a ruder sport than that practised in other
countries, and unhorsing very frequently took place.</p>

<p><i>Hohenzeuggestech</i> is an older form of the group, its main object
being the splintering of lances. In this course the jouster sat high
up on his horse in a saddle formed like a well, and his body being
well supported on all sides unhorsing was impossible as long as the
animal kept its legs and the girths held. This form of saddle had
been employed in the <i>Kolbenturnier</i> or baston course (i.e. a duel
on horseback with heavy bastons or maces), which prevailed during the
fifteenth century and which has been described. The protection on the
saddle front in <i>Hohenzeuggestech</i> rises over the rider’s breast,
a broad band of iron encircles his body, and the steels are long and
broad. The saddle weighs about 12 <i>kilos.</i> The horse ran blindfolded
in a leather bard and trapper of cloth; the rider’s legs and feet were
encased in hose and well-padded shoes, no armour being necessary, as
the saddle-steels afforded ample protection. The mobility of both man
and horse must have been much restricted by the heavy armament and by
the blindfolding and the thick cushion over the breast. The heavy
Flemish horses “did not vanish from their posts like lightning and
close in the centre of the lists like a thunderbolt,” but charged at
an amble.</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a> pictures Maximilian armed for
<i>Hohenzeuggestech</i>, as shown in <i>Freydal</i>, Plate 98.</p>

<p><i>Das gemeinedeutsche Gestech.</i> In this course the object was unhorsing,
or at least the splintering of a lance on an opponent’s shield. In
<i>Freydal</i> there are eighteen illustrations of this form of joust. The
armour for the course underwent a complete change about the beginning
of the fifteenth century, a special form of harness having been
designed for it. The legs and feet were without armour.</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_IV">Plate IV</a> illustrates two harnesses for the German joust
(<i>Gestech</i> or <i>Stechen</i>). Both date in the last quarter of the fifteenth
century, that with tassets being the later of the two. They are now at Paris.</p>

for the <i>Gestech</i> (<i>Stechen</i>). It is very heavy, weighing about a
hundredweight, leaving the wearer with little other mobility than was
needed to couch and aim his lance; it had evidently seen some service,
and bears the dents of many jousts. It is the only complete armour of
this kind that we know of in this country. The great jousting-helm
weighs about twenty pounds: it is bucket-formed, and extends down in
one piece over the top of the cuirass, to which it is fastened by
three strong screws, two in front and one behind—the latter, placed
vertically, is adjustable for getting the correct line of vision. The
crown-piece curves gently over the wearer’s head, and has a comb along
the top pierced with twin holes for attaching the crest and torse or
wreath which encircles its base. The eyelets for fastening the lining
are bordered with laton, and the rivets are capped with the same
metal, a golden looking blend, something between bronze and brass.
The <i>oculārium</i> affords but a very limited range of vision, and the
front of the head-piece juts out in a sort of beak. The helm is very
roomy, so that the wearer could move his head about freely under the
cap of felt and leather lining, and small cushions stuffed with hair
or feathers were over the temples. The breastplate is globose, and, as
usual with armour for <i>Stechen</i> and also for <i>Rennen</i>, is flattened
on the right side for better couching and aiming the lance. It is
reinforced with a heavy plate over the abdomen, to which the taces, of
five heavy lames, are riveted. The back-plate is in three overlapping
plates. A garde-rein (<i>Schwänzel</i>) of five lames protects the loins,
and the tuilles, garnished with a figure like a horn, are tile-formed.
The motons over the armpits, fastened in their places by straps of
leather, are plain and very large—9½ inches across; that on the right
side is pierced with a <i>bouche</i>, to leave space for the lance-shaft.
On the right side is a lance-rest (<i>Rüsthaken</i>), and, as is usual
in armour for both <i>Gestech</i> and <i>Scharfrennen</i>, there is a heavy
queue, termed in German a <i>Rasthaken</i>, which acted as a counterpoise
for holding the heavy lance used in the course in position, and for
avoiding much strain on the lance-arm. The lance-shaft lies in the
bed of the lance-rest, and is held under the queue behind it on the
flattened part of the cuirass, the direction towards impact being
guided by the hand. The cuirass is held together by hinged straps or
strips of iron, which are pierced for fitting over staples and are
secured by nuts. The pauldrons are each in five plates, with wings
behind, and the coudes are pointed. On the top of each shoulder is
a thin iron peg, which stands up diagonally, fixed to the armour by
laton-headed rivets. These projections are roughly about two inches
long, and are squared and topped like a nail. They were perhaps
intended as winding pegs for the tassels or jagged ends of the mantling
which usually streamed out from the jousting-helm. Such pegs are present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
on two similar harnesses at Paris. The right hand is without a
gauntlet; the arm bears the poldermiton or <i>épaule de mouton</i>, stamped
with the Augsburg guild badge; and on the bridle forearm and hand is
the stiff and heavy mainfere, the jousting gauntlet. The jousting
shield is of hard wood, covered with leather and gesso, about 15½
inches broad by 14 inches high: it is formed rectangularly at the top,
somewhat rounded at the bottom, and is slightly concave and emblazoned.
Pieces of horn are let into it to lend it elasticity and stability. It
is fastened by cords to a pierced wooden block fixed on the breastplate
and is held in position by a strap which buckles on to the helm. The
harness itself bears the Augsburg guild stamp, a fir-cone and the
letter “S” with an indistinct bar or bâton running through it. It is
dated in the last quarter of the fifteenth century. No leg-armour was
worn, so as to give the rider a better grip of his horse; hose covered
the shanks, and well-wadded shoes, of cloth or leather, the feet.</p>

<p>There is almost an exact counterpart of this suit in a harness in the
fine collection at Nuremberg, also forged at Augsburg, with the year
of make, 1498, inscribed on the armour, the only difference between
the two suits being that there are here tassets of laminated plates
instead of the solid tuilles present on the Wallace suit, the tuilles
being an indication of a somewhat earlier date. There are three similar
harnesses at Vienna. The weight of the armour with shield is usually
about 45·6 <i>kilos.</i> When arming, the different pieces are screwed on
one after the other, the jousting-shield being adjusted last.</p>

<p>The lance is of fir or pine and is stouter than that used in <i>Rennen</i>;
its greatest diameter is 9 <i>centimetres</i>, length 373 <i>cm.</i>, and weight,
with vamplate and coronal, about 14·3 <i>kilos.</i> An example may be seen
in the writer’s collection of arms and armour at Tynemouth.</p>

<p>Plate 9 in the tourney-book appertaining to the <i>Kurfürst</i> Johann (<i>des
Beständigen</i>) pictures a <i>Gestech</i> at Leipsig in 1489, between Duke
Hans of Saxony and Von Wunsdorf, in which the latter was unhorsed. The
duke wears the jousting-helm, a spiked moton is over the armpit, and
his lance is heavy and furnished with the circular form of vamplate,
viz. that used in <i>Gestech</i>. The horse wears a collar of bells
(<i>grelots</i> or <i>Schellenkette</i>), and a cushion over the breast; the
body is covered with a trapper, painted with the royal arms. The equipment
corresponds with the date of the armour shown on <a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate IX (1)</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The frontispiece of this work is taken from the tourney-book of the
<i>Kurfürst</i> Johann Friedrich (<i>des Groszüthigen</i>), Plate 81. It depicts
the <i>Kurfürst</i> running in <i>Gestech</i> at the moment when his adversary
is being hurled from his saddle. The victor’s body-armour, vamplate,
the chamfron of his horse and the coronal of his mighty lance are
all painted the colour of steel. His crest, enriched by a crown at
its base, is the Saxon emblem or badge (<i>Kleinod</i>), it is painted in
a tawny colour with black stripes. The hose are striped in colours,
green, pink, white and black; the shoes are of black felt. The trapper,
reaching down to the horse’s houges, is banded in white, blue and two
shades of red, and is sprinkled with the ciphers “XS” in gold and
silver. It bears, twice repeated, the arms of Meiszen, Thuringen,
Pfalz-Sachsen and Landsberg with the crested helm and shield of Saxony.
The horses wear necklets of bells (<i>Shellenkette</i>). The trapper of the
opposing champion is banded in shades of yellow and red sprinkled with
foliations; his crest a pair of silver horns with a coronet encircling
the base and silver laterals of linden twigs and leaves. The details of
the armour are very clear and the picture a good representative of its
class.</p>

<p><i>Das Gestech im Beinharnisch</i> is a course run with leg-armour, as
its name implies. The object is unhorsing and the splintering of lances.
The <i>Kuriss</i> saddle was employed. The presence of leg-armour rendered
unhorsing much easier of accomplishment than without it, for the belly
of the horse could not be so well gripped.</p>

<p>The joust of courtesy with pointed lances, as differentiated from
Froissart’s <i>justes mortelles</i>, was, as we have seen, much practised
throughout the fifteenth century; and it continued being run in
Germany until soon after the middle of the sixteenth, when it became
practically displaced by the joust at the tilt. This course was known
in Germany as <i>Scharfrennen</i> or <i>Schweifrennen</i>, in France as
<i>La Course à la queue</i>; it is illustrated six times in <i>Freydal</i>
and many times in the Saxon tourney-books.</p>

<p>The main desideratum of the course was unhorsing, and the form of the
saddle had been designed with that object specially in view, though
the splintering of lances also counted in the score, in fact, the
jouster who sat his horse the longest against the greatest number of
splintered lances, or without being unhelmed, was declared the victor.
The objective of the lance in this course was either the beaver of an
opponent or his jousting-shield on the left side. The first-named mark
was more difficult to hit than the other and the lance more liable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
glance off, but when fairly struck it proved irresistible. As a rule
the effect of impact was that the rider reeled in his saddle as he
tried to maintain his seat, though usually one or other of the jousters
was unhorsed, and, indeed, sometimes both fell, unless supported
at the critical moment by the varlets. The lance was held with the
point inclining slightly upwards, and, as in the other courses, the
jouster promptly withdrew his hand and arm from the shaft immediately
after impact, holding his arm upright, and the broken lance fell to
the ground. It was the omission to do this which caused the accident
resulting in the death of Henri II of France. The lance was a long,
thin, rounded straight pole of soft wood, lighter than was used in
<i>Stechen</i>, and was about 373 <i>centimetres</i> long with a largest diameter
of about 7 <i>cm.</i>, as against 9 <i>cm.</i> in the one for <i>Gestech</i>. The
vamplate is in the form of a truncated cone. <i>Rennen</i> (<i>Scharfrennen</i>)
was an even hardier course than <i>Stechen</i>, and demanded a still more
careful training in man and horse and a surer seat.</p>

<p>The salient features of this form of joust are as follows:—The saddle
employed in all its varieties was smaller and lighter than that used in
the other courses, the weight being only a little over four <i>kilos.</i>;
it had a low pommel and no cantle, and was shaped, in fact, much like
the British saddle of to-day. Jousting-cuisses (<i>Dülgen</i> or <i>Dilgen</i>,
weighing 12 <i>kilos.</i>) hung from it and protected the lower limbs of
the jouster, which were unarmoured. The armour was lighter than that
used in <i>Stechen</i>, though somewhat similar in form, and the back-plate
was shorter. The helmet was a jousting-salade (<i>Rennhut</i>) forged in
one piece, without any movable visor, but with a separate beaver
reaching well over the top of the cuirass, to which it was screwed,
back and front. It was well lined, and a cap of leather or silk was
worn. The parts of the salade extending over the temples of the wearer
were strengthened by extra plates (<i>Stirnplätter</i>); and there was a
thick reinforcing plate (<i>Magenblech</i>) over the abdomen, and to it
the heavy taces and tassets were riveted. The horse was barded as
in <i>Stechen</i>, a cushion or mattress protected the breast, and the
animal was covered with the trapper. As in <i>Stechen</i> the cuirass was
flattened on the right side, and to it the lance-rest (<i>Rüsthaken</i>) and
queue (<i>Rasthaken</i>) were screwed. The queue was smaller than that on
the harness for <i>Stechen</i>, the lance used in <i>Rennen</i> being lighter.
There were no motons over the armpits, these weak places being well
protected by the vamplate, which was larger and differently formed from
that employed in <i>Stechen</i>. The shape was that of a truncated cone.
The large concave shield of wood, covered with leather and plated with
iron, was 6 to 8 <i>cm.</i> in breadth, it was screwed on to the beaver,
and an armlet encircled the right lower arm.</p>

Suits for both <i>Rennen</i> and <i>Stechen</i> were made so that they could
be worn by a man of anything like a medium size; they were costly,
and were frequently lent out by princes and the great nobles to their
poorer brethren who lacked this equipment. A beautiful harness for
<i>Scharfrennen</i>, made for the <i>Kurfürst</i> August of Saxony (1553-1586),
by Sigmund Rockenburger, of Wittenberg, in 1554, is in the Dresden
Museum. The form of the harness is graceful, and it is richly
and tastefully etched with human figures, a double-headed eagle
and foliations; in the centre of the breastplate is a spear-like
projection—a fashion which did not last very long. The back-plate is
unusually short and so is the garde-rein (<i>Schwänzel</i>). This harness is
illustrated on <a href="#PLATE_V">Plate V</a>. The weight is about forty <i>kilos.</i>
The spurs have long shanks and are of both the rowel and prick kinds.</p>

<p>The store of armours for the tournament kept by the Saxon <i>Kurfürsts</i>
at Dresden greatly accounts for the number of historic suits preserved
there.</p>

<p>In the <i>Turnierwaffensaal</i> at the Johanneum, Dresden, is a fine
realistic representation of a <i>Scharfrennen</i>, the jousters mounted
and in complete armour down to the smallest detail. They are facing each
other, with lances in rest. The armour is etched and gilt, and every
detail is original except the under-garment, the hose and well-wadded
shoes. The period is about the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate VI</a> illustrates Maximilian II, mounted and
armed for <i>Scharfrennen</i> in 1564. The armour is in the Collection at
the Musée d’Artillerie, Paris.</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_VIII">Plate VIII (1)</a> pictures a <i>Rennen</i>, held at Minden, between
the <i>Kurfürst</i> August of Saxony and Johann von Ratzenberg. This particular
joust was termed a “<i>Gedritts</i>,” signifying that the victor in the
first encounter had still to dispose of a second antagonist in
order to gain the prize; three were thus engaged, and hence the
name. The <i>Kurfürst’s</i> second adversary was Hans von Sehönfeld. The
jousting-salade, large vamplate, jousting-cuisses and other details are
clearly shown. Numerous illustrations of <i>Scharfrennen</i> are present in
<i>Freydal</i> and in the Saxon tourney-books. There are many variants from
the main course, the most important being <i>Geschiftrennen, la course à
la targe futée</i>. It is of two kinds, <i>Geschifttartscherennen</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
(<i>tartsche</i>, a shield) and <i>Geschiftscheibenrennen</i> (<i>scheibe</i>,
a plate or disk); the wearing of a shield or a large plate or disk of iron
over the breastplate being the main distinction between them. In both
cases, when the centres of the shields were fairly struck by a lance
a mechanism was set in motion by the freeing of a spring, which in
<i>Geschifttartscherennen</i> dissolved the shield itself into fragments,
the pieces flying over the jouster’s head in wedged-formed particles.
In <i>Geschiftscheibenrennen</i>, on the right impact having been attained
the iron plate remained in its place and only the wedge in the centre
flew out. The mechanism of the first-named was much more complicated
than that of the latter.</p>

<p>Unhorsing was another of the objects in view in both cases. Both
courses would seem to have had their origin in the game of Running at
the Ring. There is an illustration of the mechanism at the back of
the shield given in a picture-codex in the Armeria at Madrid, dating
about 1544.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
The general equipment in both cases was the same as in <i>Scharfrennen</i>.</p>

<p>Illustrations of <i>Geschifttartscherennen</i> are given in <i>Freydal</i>,
both with leg-armour and without. In plates of that work. Nos. 29 and 45,
the shields are seen flying in pieces in the air and both riders are
unhorsed; while in Plate 5, here reproduced in our <a href="#PLATE_VII">Plate VII</a>,
both riders keep their seats, but the shields are seen dissolving into
fragments over the heads of the jousters. There is but one illustration
of <i>Geschiftscheibenrennen</i> in <i>Freydal</i>, viz. in Plate 41.
There are also illustrations in the <i>Triumph of Maximilian</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Bundrennen</i>, often called <i>Pundtrennen, Course appelée Bund</i>,
the jouster here also endeavoured to strike the centre of his opponent’s
shield, but the main object was unhorsing. This was the most dangerous
of all the courses, in the fact that a disrupting shield was employed,
like that used in <i>Geschifttartscherennen</i>, but without any protecting
beaver beneath it, so that the sharp lance was apt to glance off
into the jouster’s face or a fragment of the disrupted shield fly
into it, sometimes injuring the nose or eyes. This course, says the
<i>Weisskünig</i>, “was certainly amusing to look upon, though with often
sorrowful results to one or other of the combatants.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
In one of the plates of <i>Freydal</i> (No. 25), illustrating this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
course, the emperor and his opponent are both seen as being unhorsed;
while in other plates (Nos. 21, 62, 73, 93 and 204) the shields spring
disrupted into the air, but the jousters retain their seats.</p>

<p><i>Anzogenrennen, Course au pavois</i>,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
is a kind in which a very long shield was employed, which was firmly
fixed to the beaver by a large screw with a considerably projecting
head. The immediate object was unhorsing, or at least the splintering
of lances. A picture in the tourney-book of Duke William IV of Bavaria
furnishes a good illustration of the course as run in the year 1512,
and there are later examples in the tourney-books of the Saxon
<i>Kurfürsts</i>. The arms and lower limbs are unarmoured, the harness the
same as that employed in <i>Scharfrennen</i>. The shield is very long,
extending from the slit for vision in the salade down to below the
abdomen. The part over the breastplate conforms to the contour of that
piece, while below it the shield becomes concave in form. There is
usually a spike in the centre. There are twenty-five illustrations in
<i>Freydal</i> (Plates Nos. 9, 17, 50, 58, 89, 97, 141, 180 and 240), all
of which exhibit the opponents of Maximilian as being unhorsed; while in
Plate 169 both riders retain their seats. In other plates both jousters
are unseated.</p>

<p><i>Krönlrennen</i> was a freak, probably of Maximilian’s, first run in 1492.
It is called “<i>Halbierung</i>” in the tourney-book of <i>Kurfürst</i> August
of Saxony, and is a blending together of the courses <i>Scharfrennen</i>
and <i>Gestech</i>, in that one jouster wore the armour usually employed in
<i>Scharfrennen</i>, but used the lance headed with a coronal appertaining
to the <i>Gestech</i>; the other, the harness for the <i>Gestech</i> with
the sharp lance. The objects of the course were unhorsing and the
splintering of lances. Plate 6 in <i>Freydal</i> illustrates <i>Krönlrennen</i>,
and there is an excellent example given in the tourney-book of August
of Saxony, Plate I.</p>

<p>In <i>Pfannenrennen</i> the combatants ran without body-armour, except
for a square metal shield on the breast, and the horses wore hoods.</p>

<p><i>Feldrennen</i> closes the list under <i>Scharfrennen</i>. “Hoasting”
armour was employed; the saddle was that used in jousting at the tilt. The
horses were not always blindfolded, and the immediate object in view
was the splintering of lances.</p>

<p>In the <i>tourney proper</i>, or <i>mêlée</i>, field-harness with <i>Kuriss</i>
saddles were usually employed. Lances are splintered, and the combat
continued with swords.</p>

<p>One of the fifteenth century forms was the <i>Feldturnier</i>, or field
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
course, a combat of groups on horseback. Ordinary field-harness, with
or without reinforcing pieces, was usually worn. This form of contest
is illustrated in the tourney-book of Duke William IV of Bavaria,
showing that each cavalier was always provided with two swords. In what
respects it differed from the ordinary <i>mêlée</i> is not apparent.
Both swords and lances were employed.</p>

<p>The joust at the tilt has been already referred to more than once,
and some account given of its leading features. There is reason to
believe that it was practised as early as the first quarter of the
fifteenth century, and we have mentioned cases of a <i>toile</i> having been
employed at Arras in Burgundy in the year 1430, with some rather later
instances. Viscount Dillon, in his paper “Tilting in Tudor Times,”
published in the <i>Archæological Journal</i> of the year 1898,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
gives an extract from the <i>Chronicles of St. Remy</i> to the effect that the
<i>toile</i> or tilt probably originated in Portugal. As already stated, the
salient feature of this form is that it was run with a barrier between
the jousters, along which they rode in opposite directions, their left
sides towards it, until impact was effected. The first barrier was
a <i>toile</i>, a rope hung with cloth extending along the length of the
lists; but as this did not prevent the horses from bumping against one
another a tilt of planks, usually about six feet high, was devised,
which effectually kept them apart, and collisions were avoided, thus
rendering the sport much less dangerous. The use of the tilt made
impact more uncertain than when running “at the large,” and there was
usually a considerable proportion of non-attaints. The main object of
this course was the splintering of lances, though unhorsing was also in
contemplation and not unfrequently took place. Unseating was, however,
rendered difficult by the form of the saddle employed, the so-called
<i>Kuriss</i> saddle, which had a cantle behind and a high pommel in front,
thus making it much easier for a rider to keep his seat. The usual
weight of this form of saddle was a little over 9 <i>kilos.</i> Jousting at
the tilt soon greatly supplanted the earlier form in France, Italy and
England; but it took no root in Germany before the sixteenth century,
at the commencement of which it is stated to have been introduced
into that country and Austria from Italy. The name “<i>Welsch Gestech</i>”
(Italian Joust), given it in the Fatherland, tends greatly to confirm
this; and, indeed, it was just at this time that Maximilian was
introducing a new style of armour from Italy into his dominions. Though
frequently practised in Germany during the first half of the sixteenth
century, the joust at the tilt by no means displaced running “at the
large” there. Several plates in <i>Freydal</i> furnish illustrations.</p>

<a href="#PLATE_VIII_2">Plate VIII (2)</a> depicts a joust at the tilt, run at Augsburg
in 1510, between Duke William IV of Bavaria and the Pfalzgraf Friedrich of
the Rhine. The illustration is reproduced from a picture in Hans
Schwenkh’s <i>Wappenmeisterbuch</i>, the tourney-book of the duke, who is
seen jousting; it is a work which has already been referred to in
these pages. The tilt itself, of three broad planks, is of massive
construction. The harness worn in the earlier form was the <i>Stechzeug</i>,
the kind that was used in the German <i>Gestech</i>, with no leg-armour,
a style which has been already described and illustrated on <a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate IX (1)</a>.
The cuirass employed is flattened on the lance side, and there is
a <i>Rasthaken</i> or queue as well as a lance-rest. Bases are worn by the
riders, and a crest of plumes. The trapper of the duke’s horse, dark in
colour, is shot with painted rays over the body, and a picture of the
Sun in Splendour encircles the horse’s tail, which is further decorated
with plumes. A collar of <i>grelots</i> is around the neck of the animal;
the head is adorned with plumes, and the chamfron embellished with a
picture of the sun. The lances with coronals are well shown; the former
are long poles narrowing gently towards the heads, and the latter are
in three short prongs.</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_XI">Plate XI (1)</a> pictures two fine suits at Paris for jousting
at the tilt, one of them with the manifer or mainfere, the passe-guard and
poldermiton in their places.</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_X">Plate X (1)</a> illustrates a German harness, at Dresden,
for this form of joust. It dates about 1580. There are three armours for jousting
at the tilt in the Wallace Collection of Arms and Armour at London,
Catalogue Numbers 484, 495 and 505. The first of these is a harness
for <i>Realgestech</i>, as shown by the cross-ribbed shield, a device for
affording a grip for the coronal of the lance on impact in order to
prevent it from glancing off—another departure in the direction of
greater safety for the jouster. This course was a late variety of the
joust at the tilt.</p>

<p>No. 505, illustrated on <a href="#PLATE_IX_2">Plate IX (2)</a> is perhaps somewhat
earlier in date than the other two suits, for in the right side of the
“volante-piece” is a little square door or window, for enabling the
wearer to converse freely when open. This aperture is about three
inches square in size and freely perforated so as to admit air to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
wearer when closed. It is shut, of course, when the jouster is ready
for his career. In other respects the three suits are very much alike;
and the “peaescod-bellied” breastplates of all of them tend to fix
their date within narrow limits. The shields of Nos. 495 and 505 are
practically the same in form and size. They fit round the front of the
left side of the neck and cover the left shoulder and breast, running
nearly straight down to the middle of the breastplate. The grand-guards
are screwed to the upper parts of the breastplate and the shields are
attached to them in like manner. The other reinforcing pieces are
either present with the suits, or the armour is holed for them.</p>

<p>The sad accident which resulted in the death of Henri II, of France, at
a <i>fête d’armes</i> held at Paris in 1559, was in a joust at the tilt with
the Comte de Montgomeri. It was caused by the Comte failing to drop his
splintered lance in good time.</p>

<p>The drawings of Hans Burgmaier in the <i>Triumph of Maximilian</i> afford
illustrations of some of the varieties of the German jousting of the
period.</p>

<p>Plate 45 illustrates the <i>Welsch Gestech</i> (Italian Joust) or Joust
at the Tilt. The head-piece is the jousting-helm and the reinforcing
pieces are in their places. The lance, tipped with a coronal,
is lighter than that employed in the German <i>Gestech</i> and in
<i>Scharfrennen</i> and the vamplate is circular in form. Feather plumes
are worn.</p>

<p>Plate 46 pictures the Gestech or German joust (<i>Das gemeine deutsche
Gestech</i>). The head-piece is the same as that on Plate 45. A cushion
is worn over the horse’s chest, and a <i>Rasthaken</i>, or queue, and a
<i>Rüsthaken</i>, or lance-rest, are on the flattened right side of the
cuirass. The lance is heavy and tipped with a coronal. The crests shown
are very fanciful.</p>

<p>Plate 47 illustrates <i>Hohenzeuggestech</i>. The jousters are seated
on the high saddles (<i>im hohen Zeug</i>) peculiar to the course. The
jousting-helm is worn. Lances are tipped with coronals, as is the case
with all varieties of the <i>Gestech</i>.</p>

<p>Plate 48. <i>Das Gestech im Beinharnisch.</i> This is a variety of
<i>Gestech</i> in which leg-armour is worn, as the name implies.</p>

<p>Plates 50 and 55 picture <i>Bundrennen</i>, the peculiarity of the course
being that no beaver is worn beneath the disrupting shield. This makes
it the most dangerous of all the courses, and injuries to the face were
frequent. The vamplate is large and formed like a truncated cone.</p>

<p>Plate 51 depicts <i>Geschifttartscherennen</i>, in which course the shield,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
when struck by the lance on a certain spot, dissolves in fragments over
the jouster’s head.</p>

<p>Plate 52. It pictures <i>Geschiftscheibenrennen</i>, a course similar
in principle to the last-named, the difference being that the shield is
a disk which, when properly struck, flies into the air, or the shield
remains in its place but the plug in the centre flies out.</p>

<p>Plate 53. The cavaliers are here accoutred for the pan joust
(<i>Pfannenrennen</i>). There are one or two other varieties of the
joust depicted.</p>

<p>Several combats on foot of the fifteenth century, perhaps the most
dangerous items of the articles of a <i>pas d’armes</i> of that period,
have been fully described in Chapters III, IV and V, in the narrations
by contemporary chroniclers of actual encounters. The character of
these contests underwent a great change in the sixteenth century,
through the introduction of barriers over which the combatants fought.
These bars or barriers reached up to the breasts of the fighters,
and prevented their grappling with each other or getting out of
bounds. They made their appearance probably in the last decade of
the fifteenth century. As the tilt had been conceived with a view
towards mitigating the danger of the joust, so barriers were adopted
towards minimizing the risk of serious injuries in fighting on foot,
and, indeed, the new style was hardly more dangerous than the game
of football as played to-day. This latest phase is well described by
Viscount Dillon in “Barriers and Foot Combats,” a paper published in
the <i>Archæological Journal</i> of 1904.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
The special features of the armour for combats of this kind are its
massive character, the presence of an apron (<i>Kampfschurtz</i>, a sort of
continuation of the taces), and the large, thick, globose bascinet. A
fine armour for foot-fighting in the lists may be seen in the Tower
of London. It is a grand piece of work, weighing about 93 lbs., sent
by Maximilian of Austria to our Henry VIII. The Vienna Collection
possesses seven complete armours for fighting on foot, which vary
considerably, both in form and weight. The weapons employed in these
contests in Germany and Austria, as given in <i>Freydal</i>, are the
sword in different forms, including the “bastard” (a hand and a half
sword), the dussack, the <i>Kurisschwert</i> or armying-sword, and even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
two-handed sword (<i>Zweihänder</i> or <i>Schlachtschwert</i>), the dagger,
battle-axe (including the <i>bec de faucon</i>), mace, halbard, <i>ranseur</i>,
guisarme, <i>Aalspiesse</i> (a short-shafted spear with rondel-guard),
<i>Langspiess</i> (a short lance), <i>Würfspiess</i> (a javelin), <i>Stange</i>
(a quarter-staff), and <i>Drischel</i> (the military flail).</p>

<p>The <i>Fussturnier</i>, which originated in the sixteenth century, was
a fighting in groups on foot over a barrier, and in it and some other
courses the challengers were termed “Maintenators” and their opponents
“Aventuriers.” Each combatant had to deliver three thrusts with the
lance and four strokes with the sword. Dr. Cornelius Curlitt gives the
following extract from <i>Acten des Dresdener Oberhofmarshallamtes</i>
of the year 1614:—“The one who shivers the greatest number of lances in
the most adroit manner shall have the lance prize; and he who in five
strokes strikes the bravest and strongest with the sword shall have the
second prize.” The locking gauntlet was forbidden, and the lower limbs
were without armour. A harness for this kind of fighting, by Anton
Peffenhaüser, worn by the <i>Kurfürst</i> Johan George of Saxony in 1613,
is now in the Dresden Museum. The head-piece is a burgonet.</p>

<p>An important later form of joust is the <i>Freiturnier</i>, or Free Course,
which grew out of the old German <i>Gestech</i>, and, like it, was run “at
the large,” that is without a tilt. There is a harness for this course
at Dresden, reproduced on <a href="#PLATE_X_2">Plate X (2)</a>. The passguard is
much larger than that worn in jousting at the tilt, reaching nearly to the left
shoulder. Leg-armour was worn. The harness illustrated in Boeheim’s
<i>Waffenkunde</i> (Fig. 655) as being for the <i>Welsch Gestech</i>, or joust
at the tilt, is really for <i>Freiturnier</i>, a form of joust which does not
appear before the second half of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>As already stated, the suit in the Wallace Collection, numbered
484 in the catalogue of that institution, is for <i>Realgestech</i> or
<i>Plankengestech</i>, a variety of joust at the tilt. It first appeared
about 1540, and did not differ materially from the main course; nor did
the armour employed differ except for the cross-ribbing on the shield.
This course, like the others, fell into disuse in the seventeenth
century, though it was the last to survive except the one called
<i>Scharmützel</i>, often a sort of general siege or skirmish, with a view
to practice for actual warfare. A <i>Scharmützel</i> was held at Dresden
in 1553, when four bands of horsemen attacked a mock fortress, defended
by a garrison armed with <i>Aalspiesse</i> and military forks, and supplied
with four hundred earthenware pots for missiles, to be thrown empty.
Cannon were employed on both sides, presumably fired in blank, though
this is not stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
The foregoing comprise the most distinctive forms of the tourney.</p>

<p>There were permanent lists in Germany, as also at Calais; and in
England, at Westminster, Hampton Court, and Greenwich.</p>

<p>The quintain and running at the ring have been described in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>,
and there only remains the <i>Karoussel</i>, or <i>Carrousel</i>, to be
mentioned. The name is derived from <i>carosello</i>, a ball of clay, which
was hollow. The game was a favourite one at the court of Louis XIV,
where it gave rise to handsome dresses and costly display. The players,
arranged in opposing bands or sides, were mounted and threw these
missiles at one another, catching them on their shields. There were
several varieties of the game.</p>

<p>Harness for the tiltyard was usually made thicker than that for field
purposes and was thus somewhat heavier. Much taste and labour were
expended on its ornamentation.</p>

<p>Though the best armour was imported from Italy and Germany, a large
proportion of that in use in England was made at home, and, indeed,
there is plenty of evidence that this is so. Henry VIII, like
Maximilian, took a strong personal interest in all that related to
arms and armour, and was very desirous that the form and quality of
harness made in England should be improved. With this object in view,
he arranged with the emperor for German smiths to be sent to Greenwich,
and some really fine armours were made there during his reign and
later, many of which have been preserved, though the iron billets
used in forging them were imported from Innsbruck, English iron not
having been found to be of a sufficient tensile strength for the best
purposes. Whether this inferiority lay in the process of puddling the
iron or to the presence of any considerable proportion of deleterious
elements, such as sulphur and phosphorous, is another matter. Henry
VIII established his “Almain Armouries” at Greenwich about the year
1514.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The form of “Hoasting” armour underwent several important changes
during the course of the sixteenth century and to the time when
body-armour fell into general disuse. The changes had their origin,
mainly, in new departures in the fashion of the civil dress; indeed,
the shape of the doublet of each period is faithfully reflected in that
of the cuirass of steel. This following of the modes of the day by the
smith sometimes resulted in the production of harness which, however
effective from a spectacular point of view, proved most unsuitable for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
service in the field. This was greatly owing to the abandonment of the
principle of a glancing surface on the armour, thus tending to effect
lodgment for strokes from weapons of attack, instead of deflecting them.</p>

<p>The elegant form of “Gothic” armour of the connoisseur had been
modelled, as we have seen, after the shapely Florentine dress of the
fifteenth century: but a radical and far-reaching change took place
at the commencement of the sixteenth, following on a new departure in
civil costume. This style, <i>armatura spigolata</i>, is usually known
as “Maximilian,” named after the emperor, and would seem to have been
introduced by him in his extensive dominions from Italy, after his
Italian campaign in 1496. That “Maximilian” armour was of Italian
origin is clear by the very name it bore in Germany at the time, viz.
“<i>Mailander Harnisch</i>.” The leading features of this type are:—the
globose form of the breastplate; the abnormally wide-toed solerets,
following the new fashion in shoes, “bear-paw” or “cow-mouthed” as
they were commonly called; the heightening of the shoulder or neck
guards (pieces often, though erroneously, termed pass-guards, a mistake
pointed out by Viscount Dillon in one of his valuable and suggestive
papers on armour); and the substitution of laminated tassets in place
of the solid, tile-formed tuilles. The head-piece is the armet, the
most perfect as well as the most familiar form of helmet—of which,
however, there are several varieties. This armour was usually made
fluted, though sometimes plain. When fluted, the whole surface down to
the jambs, which are always smooth, is covered with narrow, regular
radiating flutings, differing in that respect from “Gothic” armour,
with its broad, sweeping flutings and ridgings.</p>

<p>Tonlet armour (<i>à tonne</i>) has a deep skirt of hoops called “jambers,”
standing out all round like a more modern crinoline, and moving up
and down like the laths of a Venetian blind. It also had its origin
in Italy, and was copied from the civil skirts of the doublet of the
period, called “bases”; which when reproduced in steel were clumsy
and unwieldy. We have here an apt illustration of the lengths people
will sometimes go in slavishly following a particular fashion, however
clumsy or unsuitable it might be. This style of armour was greatly
employed in fighting on foot, though a variety was adapted for use on
horseback. A fine and historic armour for fighting on foot, made by
Conrad Seusenhofer of Innsbruck, may be seen in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Bards probably had their origin in the twelfth century, though there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
little mention of them in English records before the close of the
thirteenth, but in the fourteenth they would appear to have become
fairly common. The chamfron, crinet and peytral are observable in
engravings of the fourteenth century, when they were probably of
<i>cuir-bouille</i>. In the <i>Histoire de Charles VII</i> it is stated that
a combat, <i>à outrance</i>, took place in the year 1446, between the
Seigneurs de Ternant and Galiot de Balthasin,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
in which the latter was mounted “<i>sur un puissant cheval, liquil selon
la costume de Lombardie estoit tout convert de fer</i>.” A complete
equipment of steel plate for the horse was attained in the second half
of the fifteenth century, when, according to a picture in the arsenal
at Vienna, painted in 1480, “<i>Der Ritter sitz auf seinem bis auf die
Hufe verdecten Hengst</i>.” A fine bard which had belonged to Henry VIII,
weighing 92½ lbs., may be seen in the Tower of London. Bards for the
tourney were usually of leather.</p>

<p>The expression “trapped and barded,” so frequently met with in records,
is often misunderstood. The bard is a defence for the horse, while the
trapper is its outside textile covering.</p>

<p>The importance of lightly-armed troops in warfare became steadily
greater, and even as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century
a large proportion of the armour for the field was made lighter, and
demi-harnesses were employed for light cavalry.</p>

<p>The imitation in steel of the civil costume was carried to absurd
lengths, as is glaringly shown in the so-called “<i>Pfeifenharnis</i>”
(pipe-harness), forged after the picturesque dress of the period, with
its pipings, puffs or rolls, points and slashes. Illustrations of it
may be seen in the <i>Triumph of Maximilian</i>. In a suit in the Wallace
Collection (catalogue No. 555) the details of the dress have been
faithfully and minutely reproduced in metal. The very fabric of the
civil costume has been imitated and the slashes are gilded. Harness was
freely and delicately etched, engraved, damascened, and decorated with
repoussé work; and some of the ornamentation did away altogether with
the glancing surface of the armour, thus greatly militating against its
efficiency for military purposes.</p>

<p>A fine armour in the Zeughaus, at Berlin, affords an excellent example
of the best work of about the middle of the sixteenth century. It is by
Peter von Speyer, of Annaberg, made for the <i>Kurfürst</i> Joachim II, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Brandenburg, whose arms decorate the breastplate. The helm is of
the type of armet without collar. The peak in the cuirass tends
to be placed lower down as the century advances, until at length
the “peascod” form is reached, as shown on <a href="#PLATE_IX_2">Plate IX (2)</a>.
Here the breastplate is of the true Elizabethan “peascod” form, converging
to a retreating point at the bottom. You have this shape exactly in
portraits of the Earl of Leicester, and, indeed, of the queen herself.
The tassets swell out over the hips, another feature observable in the
portraits. This form continued, with some modifications, up to nearly
the end of the century.</p>

<i>Du Bon Chevalier, Sans Paour et Sans Reproche, Gentil
Seigneur De Bayart</i>, gives some account of Bayard’s combats in the
lists. The Chevalier was born in 1476 and died in 1524, and his first
fights on foot and on horseback took place when he was a raw, growing
stripling of eighteen. This was on the occasion when the Burgundian
Chevalier, Claude de Vauldray, came to Lyons in 1494 to accomplish
a deed of arms—“<i>à course de lance et coups de hache</i>”; and the
young Bayard, though without possessing an equipment for the joust or
means of procuring one, conceived the idea of engaging this redoubted
champion in combat. The difficulty as to horse and armour was solved
by the coming forward of a kinsman, L’Abbe d’Esnay, with the necessary
cash. After several chevaliers of the French court had encountered De
Vauldray, Bayard entered the lists to do battle. No particulars of the
combat itself are given by the chronicler, but the account states that
the youngster bore himself right gallantly; and the verdict of the
ladies on the stand erected for their accommodation, expressed in the
Lyonese dialect, “<i>Vey-vo cestou malotru, il a mieulx fay que tous los
autres</i>.”</p>

<p>Soon the young Bayard, advancing towards fame and fortune, caused a
proclamation to be made for a <i>pas d’armes</i> to be held at the town of
Ayre, in Picardy, on the 20th July, 1494, <i>Pour l’amour des dames</i>.
The articles of combat provided that “hoasting” armour be worn, and on
the first day three courses be run with rebated lances and afterwards
twelve strokes exchanged with the sword, all on horseback; on the
morrow the combats to be on foot at barriers, high as the <i>nombril</i>,
with lances and later with axes. Prizes were offered to the successful
competitors as follows:—For the first day a bracelet of gold,
enamelled with Bayard’s device, of the value of thirty <i>ecus</i>; and for
the second day a diamond worth forty <i>ecus</i>. The proclamation runs:—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<div lang="fr" class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>Pierre de Bayart, jeune gentil-homme et apprentif des
armes, natif de Daulphiné, des ordonnances du roy de France, soubz
la charge et</i> <i>conduicte de hault et puissant Seigneur monseigneur
de Ligny, faisoit crier et publier ung tourney au dehors de la ville
d’Ayre, et joignant les murailles à tous venans, au vingtiesme jour de
juillet, de trois coups de lance sans lice, à fer esmolu, et en harnoys
de guerre; et douze coups d’espée, le tout à cheval. Et au mieulx
faisant donnoit ung brasselet d’or esmaillé de sa livrée, et du prix de
trente escuz. Le lendemain seriot combatu à pied, a poux de lance, à
une barrière de la halteur du nombril; et après la lance rompue à coups
de hache, jusques à la discrétion des juges et de ceulx qui garderoient
le camp. Et au mieulx faisoit donnoit ung dyamant du pris de quarante escus.</i>”</p></div>

<p>On the first day, on the trumpet sounding, <i>le bon Chevalier</i> presented
himself for the first course, his adversary being a neighbour from
Dauphiny named Tartarin, in which the latter broke his lance within
six inches of the head, thus forfeiting a point; and jousting between
other cavaliers lasted until evening. On the second day Bayard fought
at barriers against a Messire Honotin de Sucre, first with lances and
afterwards with axes. Bayard struck his adversary two heavy blows over
the region of the ear, the second of which bore him to the ground.
Other foot encounters followed, after which the prizes for the two
days were awarded by the judges to <i>le bon Chevalier</i>, as having done
the best on both days, but he refused to accept them, and they were
adjudged to other champions who came next in order of merit.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
The Chevalier’s next tourney was at Carignan, in Italy, at which he gained
the prize.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Chapter XXII tells how <i>le bon Chevalier</i> fought at barriers at Andre
with Don Alonce de Soto-Majori. Bayard had wished the combat to be on
horseback, owing to some trouble in his legs which hindered locomotion;
but the Spaniard insisted all the more on fighting on foot, and this
was finally arranged to take place. The weapons selected were estocs
and daggers, and the fight commenced with an exchange of thrusts with
the former, in which Soto-Majori was slightly wounded in the face; then
Bayard, making a feint, thrust his sword right through the neck of his
adversary, inflicting a fatal wound. The Spaniard, in his death agony,
clutched the body of the Frenchman with his arms and both combatants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
fell to the ground. Bayard then drew his dagger, crying, “<i>Rendez vous,
Seigneur Alonce, ou vous estes mort</i>”; but he had hardly uttered the
words when the Spaniard expired. The Chevalier then knelt down and
thanked God for his victory.</p>

<p>The Chevalier’s next combat was at Monervyne, in the Kingdom of
Naples, thirteen Spaniards against the same number of Frenchmen,
which took place during a truce between the two armies, the leaders
of this encounter being the Seigneur d’Oroze and <i>le bon Chevalier</i>
respectively. A condition of the articles of combat was that any
cavalier on being unhorsed should render himself a prisoner to the side
opposing him. The fight began, and the Spaniards unchivalrously aimed
their lances at the horses of their adversaries instead of at their
riders; but, in spite of this dishonourable ruse, the honours of the
battle are stated to have lain with the Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Other examples of Bayard’s prowess and chivalry in the tournament are
given in the chronicle. The dates given by chroniclers of jousts and
<i>pas d’armes</i> are apt to vary somewhat, partly owing to the different
methods of computing the regnant years of a king.</p>

<p>A manuscript in the College of Arms, London, gives an account of
the <i>pas d’armes</i> held at Westminster in honour of the marriage of
Katharine of Arragon with Prince Arthur, the heir to the throne, in the
seventeenth year of King Henry VII (1501). This narration is apparently
the work of an official present at the meeting, and an abridged account
of it follows here. Besides jousts and <i>mêlées</i>, there were fights
at barriers, pageants, and mummeries most splendid, costly, fanciful and
elaborate. A tilt was erected in the open space before Westminster
Hall, and adjoining the lists were gaily decorated stands and galleries
for the king, court and other spectators. For the knights, nobles and
esquires taking part there were within the lists pavilions, which
were removed before the jousting began. The first jousting is thus
described:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“And at furst curse ran the Duke of Bokyngham and
the Lord Marquyes; and the duke brake his staff right well, and wt
great sleight and stringht, upon the Lord Marquyes; and at the secunde
curse the Lord Marquyes brake his staff oppon the Duke in like wise;
and then the residue of the Lords and Knights ranne orderly togiders,
and, for the most parte at every curse, other the on staf, other
the other, or moost comonly bothe, were goodly and wt great art and
strength, brokyn of meny pecys; that such a feld, and justs ryall, so
noble and valiantly doon, have not been sene ne hard; the which goodly
feats, and those of the descripcion apperyth weil pleynn, and more
opyn, in the bokys of the Harolds of Armys.”</p>

<p>There is nothing said of the lances employed in the first day’s
jousting, as to whether they were rebated or not, but the courses which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
follow on the succeeding days are expressly stated to have been run
with pointed lances “at the large.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
We may thus assume that the running of the first day was at the tilt
(else why its erection at all?), and that lances with coronals were
employed. Afterwards there was a <i>mêlée</i>, the weapons being “armyng
swords” (i.e. <i>estocs</i>). On the fourth day jousting was again followed
by a tourney (<i>mêlée</i>).<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
The lances were tipped with coronals, and the weapons in the tourney
were estocs, as before. Many of the cavaliers were unhorsed in the
jousting and in the <i>mêlée</i>: “Sume of their swords were brokyn in two
peces, and sume other their harneis was heuen off from their body, and
felle into the feld.” Then the prizes, consisting of diamonds, rubies
and rings of gold, were awarded.</p>

<p>In 1502 a “Solemne Triumphe” was held in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Plate 118 in <i>Das Turnierbuch Johan des Beständigen, Kurfürst</i>
of Saxony, depicts a course with sharp lances, run at Naumburg in 1505,
between Duke Hans of Saxony and Georg von Brandestein. The duke keeps
his seat, but his opponent is unhorsed. The armour is of the kind
usually employed in this course (<i>Scharfrennen</i>).</p>

<p>In the <i>Turnierhuch</i> of Duke William of Bavaria is a picture of an
<i>Anzogenrennen</i>, held in the year 1512. The body-armour employed is
that used in all the varieties of <i>Rennen</i>, though the shield in
this course is much larger than in the others, extending up to the
<i>ocularium</i> of the jousting-salade, thus covering the face. This shield
has been described under the heading <i>Anzogenrennen</i>. The armour with
the shield is illustrated by Boeheim.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>There was jousting at Paris in 1513, at which the Duc de Valois was the
chief tenant, and many courses were run.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Jousts were held at Lille, in the same year, in a large hall paved
with black marble, and the horses were shod with felt to prevent their
slipping.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>In 1515, in honour of the marriage of the king, jousts took place at
Paris, which had been proclaimed by the Dauphin, as follows:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Nemelie, that he with nine aides should answer
all commers, being gentlemen of name and armes. First, to run fiue
courses at the tilt with péeces of advantage<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>;
after fiue courses at random<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
with sharpe speares, and twelue strokes with sharpe swords; and that
doone, he and his aids to fight at the barriers with all gentlemen of
name and armes. First, six foins with hand speares, and after that
eight strokes to the most aduantage if the speares so long held, and
after that twelue strokes with the sword; and if any man be vnhorsed or
felled with fighting on foot, then his horse and armour to be rendered
to the officer of armes; and eueri man of this challenge must set vp
his armes and name vpon an arch triumphant, which shalbe made at the
place where the iusts shalbe, and further shall write to what point he
will answer, to one or all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
When this <i>fête d’armes</i> was proclaimed in England, “the duke of
Suffolke, the marquis of Dorset and his four brethrern, the lord
Clinton, sir Edward Neuille, sir Giles Capell, Thomas Cheneie
and others sued the king to be at the chalenge, which request he
gratiouslie granted.” “The Dolphin desired the duke of Suffolke and the
marquess Dorset to be two of his immediate aids, which they thereto
assented.” Four shields were set up—viz. silver, gold, black and
tawny—under which the venans were to write their names, electing, in
their order, whether to run at the tilt, in the open with sharp lances,
to fight on foot with one-handed swords, or lastly, with two-handers.
This <i>pas d’armes</i> continued over three days, during which 305
cavaliers each ran five courses, some with sharp lances, and several
were killed. In the joust in the open the Duke of Suffolk wounded an
antagonist almost to the death. The Dauphin was wounded in the hand,
so that he was unable to take further part. Many other particulars and
details of this passage of arms are given by Holinshed.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Among the Ashmolean MSS. is one relating to the proclamation of
jousts to be held at a later date and to letters of safeguard issued
to intending venans. The document is of the year 1520, and runs as follows:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“The lettres of savegarde given by the said King
of England [Henry VIII] unto Thomas Walle al’s Norrey King of Armes,
for the proclamacōn of the same Ioustes in the parties of Almayn and
the contrye of Germania, wch Norrey proclaimed thē welle in French for
the lowe contreys, as in High Dutch as hereafter followeth ＆c.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>In foot contests there was a rule that no one who had seen a challenger
fight on foot on any previous occasion was allowed to engage him. It is
difficult to understand the reason for this condition, and it was often
waived on permission being given by an intended opponent.</p>

<p>Charles V, in January, 1518, two years before he became emperor, took
part in a tournament at which twelve horses were killed; and in another
in the March following, when seven cavaliers lost their lives.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Henry VIII, like his friend Maximilian of Austria, took great delight
in the tourney and in the pageantry so frequently combined with it, and
much money and labour was expended in staging the many functions of
the kind held during his reign. Henry greatly encouraged these martial
games and frequently took part in them; indeed, Hall remarks “that the
king was not minded to see young gentlemen inexpert in martial feats.”
This chronicler positively revels in picturing these brilliant scenes,
devoting himself more especially to their spectacular aspect, and
giving full details of the dresses and equipment of those taking part,
together with particulars of the general surroundings, though little
is said of the martial games themselves. The pageantry and mummeries
associated with the tournament were often of almost incredible
puerility, and they detracted greatly from the dignity of these warlike
sports. There were many childish conceits at these gatherings, all
showing that the tourney had reached an advanced stage of its decline.
Such costly shows went greatly out of fashion after the death of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Jousts, combined with pageants, were held in honour of the coronation
of the king, and Holinshed thus describes them:—“For the more honour
and innobling of the triumphant coronation, there were prepared both
iusts and turneis to be doone in the palace of Westminster, where, for
the king’s grace and the queen’s, was framed a faire house, couered
with tapestrie, and hanged with rich clothe of Arras, and in the said
palace was made a curious founteine and ouer it a castell, on the top
thereof a great crowne imperiall, all the imbatelling with roses and
pomgranats gilded,” and many other conceits.</p>

<p>The tenans in the jousting on this occasion were Thomas, Lord Howard;
his brother, Sir Edward Howard; Lord Richard, the Admiral; Lord
Richard, brother to the Marquis of Dorset; Sir Edmund Howard; Sir
Thomas Knevit and Charles Brandon, Esquire. Their bases and trappers
were of green velvet, charged with roses and pomegranates of gold
fringed with damask gilded.</p>

<p>The venans were Sir John Pechie, Sir Edward Neville, Sir Edward
Guildford, Sir John Carr, Sir William Parr, Sir Giles Capell, Sir
Griffith Dun and Sir Roulande. Their bases and trappers were of tissue,
cloth of gold, silver and velvet.</p>

<p>The second day was devoted to the <i>mêlée</i>. No details of the jousting
itself or of the tourney are given. Both Hall and Holinshed describe
this meeting.</p>

On the twelfth of January following jousts were held in the park at
Richmond “vnknown to the kynges grace, whereof, he beyng secretly
informed, caused hymself and one of his priue chambre, called Willyā
Compton to be secretly armed, and so came into the Iustes vnknowen
to all persones and vnloked for. The kyng ranne neuer openly before,
and there were broken many staues, and greate praise geuen to the two
straungers, but specially to one, whiche was the kyng.” “Master Compton
was sore hurte and likely to dye.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Holinshed tells us that in May, 1510, the king with his aides
challenged all comers to fight at barriers at Greenwich, viz. casting
the spear and twelve strokes with two-handed swords. Henry much
distinguished himself by his great strength and judgment.</p>

<p>On the 13th November in the same year Henry, with Charles Brandon and
“Mayster” Compton, answered all comers for two days, the first at the
tilt, the second at the tourney. “At these iusts the king brake more
staves than any other, and therefore had the pryse: at the Turney in
likewyse the honor was his.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The original Roll of the “Iusts” held at Westminster on the 13th
February, 1511, in honour of Queen “Katherin” on the birth of Prince
Henry, is now in the College of Arms, London. It is of parchment, 14½
inches broad, the figures of the combatants and others being from seven
to eight inches in height; and the whole is in an excellent state of
preservation. The roll is headed with the words “Viue le noble Roy H.
VIII,” followed by a large device of a rose and pomegranates surmounted
by a crown, impaled with the letters H and K. Some of the figures are
armed at all points, while others are in civil dress, thus constituting
an invaluable record of the costumes of the day.</p>

<p>The picture of the procession to the lists is headed by “Le Maistre
de Armurerye du Roy,” in civil dress, with his guard, and immediately
after him follow the sergeant-at-arms, holding his crowned bâton of
office; then five trumpeters, one of them a negro. In their order march
after them a band of courtiers, and “Les Officiers d’Armes,” being
heralds and pursuivants, in tabard-shaped surcoats. Then come the four
tenans, each riding under a “Pauilion,” with their varlets. Two led
horses immediately follow the king, and they afford a good opportunity
for observing the saddles employed in jousting at the tilt. After them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
ride “Les pages du Roy,” the marshal of the lists, “Le grant Escuyer,”
and “Le maistre des Pages.” The tenans are seen approaching the
gaily-decorated stand, in which the queen and her court are seated,
and the venans are reaching it on the other side. The picture closes
with the king on horseback in civil dress—“Le Roy desarmey”—holding
a broken lance in his hand. He is preceded by his helm-bearer, on
horseback, carrying the head-piece of his majesty on a truncheon.
The helm is surmounted by a royal crown, enriched with gold, pearls,
diamonds and rubies.</p>

<p>The roll concludes with a poem, in which the name of the king figures
among a band of heroes, the others being Hector, Cæsar, Judas
Maccabæus, Joshua, Charlemagne, King Arthur, Alexander, David and
Codefroi de Bouillon.</p>

<p>Hall’s florid account of this meeting, in a much abridged form, is as
follows:—The jousting was combined with a pageant picturing a forest
in which stood a castle of gold, and before it sat a gentleman weaving
a garland of roses for the prize. Jousting began on the twelfth, and on
the morrow there was a grand procession to the lists. The king was on
horseback, armed at all points, riding under a “Pauilion” of cloth of
gold and purple velvet, embroidered and powdered over with the letters
“H” and “K” of fine gold, surmounted by an imperial golden crown and
valanced with hanging wire of the same precious metal. The king’s bases
and the trapper of his charger were of cloth of gold, fretted with
damask gold; his crinet and chamfron were of steel, and on the latter
was a plume garnished with golden spangles. Then followed his three
aides, each riding under a “Pauilion” of crimson damask and purple,
powdered over with the letters “H” and “K” in fine gold, valanced and
fringed with damask gold, and on the top of each canopy a great “K”
of goldsmith’s work. After them marched a number of gentlemen and
yeomen on foot, clad in russet and yellow cloth; then twelve children
of honour, mounted on great coursers richly caparisoned. Then in the
counterpart rode the “venantz,” headed by Sir Charles Brandon,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
who appears first on horseback in a long robe of russet satin, like
a recluse, and he petitions the queen for permission to joust in her
presence. His request having been granted, he doffed his cloak and
appeared in full armour, with rich bases, and his horse nobly trapped
for running at the tilt. In attendance on him were divers men clad in
russet satin. Next came young Henry Guilford, Esquire, himself and
horse in russet cloth of gold and cloth of silver, embroidered with a
device like a castle or turret, and all his men in russet satin and
white, with hose of the same and bonnets of a like colour; and he also
petitioned the queen for permission to run. After him rode the Marquis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of Dorset and Sir Thomas Bulleyn,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
dressed as pilgrims in tabards of black velvet, with palmer’s hats over
their helmets and long Jacob’s staffs in their hands. Their horses
were trapped in black velvet, which, like their hats and tabards, was
garnished with scallop shells of fine gold; their servants were in
black satin, with the same kind of shells pinned to their breasts. Then
came Lord Henry of Buckingham, Earl of Wiltshire, himself and his horse
draped in cloth of silver, embroidered with a “posye” of golden arrows
and roses, and above the flowers the figure of a greyhound in silver
holding a tree of pomegranates in gold. Then entered Sir Giles Capell,
Sir Roulande and many other knights, richly armed and apparelled.</p>

<p>The jousting began and was gallantly achieved, the prize being awarded
to the king. The proceedings were followed by music and the dance,
closing with a pageant.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
What a contrast between this passage of arms and the tournament held in
1278, <i>temp.</i> Edward I, as described in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>.</p>

<p>Ashmole, No. 1116, fol. 109-10b, runs as follows:—“Iustes holden at
Westminster the XIIth daie of February by the Kinges grace called Cueur
Loyal, the Lord William of Devon Bon Voloir, Sir Thomas Knevit Valiant
Desire, and Edward Nevell Joyous Penser, with the articles and courses
of the said Iustes,” etc. The articles begin thus—“The noble lady
Renowne considering the good and gracious fortune....” The “courses”
(checques) were tilting tablets for recording the scores for two days
(Wednesday and Thursday, February 12th, 13th, 1511), marked with
strokes, and accounts of the “best Ioustres.”</p>

<p>In the tournament illustrated on the Herald’s College Roll it is stated
that 264 courses were run at the tilt and but 129 attaints made.
The tenans scored seventy-seven of these, the king himself making
thirty-eight hits out of fifty-two courses. Of the venans, one made no
hits at all and six only struck once in six courses.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Another meeting took place on the 1st May following, at which the
tenans were the king, Sir Edward Howard, Charles Brandon and Sir Edward
Nevil; the venans being the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Devon, the
Marquis of Dorset and Lord Howard.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

In the fourth year of King Henry’s reign—</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">“the King had a solempne iust at
Grenewiche in Iune: first came in ladies all in White and Red silke,
set vpon Coursers trapped in the same suite, freated ouer with gold,
after which folowed a Fountain curiously made of Russet sattin, with
eight Gargilles spoutyng water, within the fountain sat a knight armed
at all peces. After the Fountain folowed a lady all in black silke
dropped with fine siluer, on a courser trapped in the same. After
folowed a knight in a horse litter, the Coursers and litter apparareled
in blacke velvet with siluer droppes. When the Fountain came to the
tilt, the Ladies rode rounde aboute, and so did the Fountain and the
knight within the litter. And after them wer brought twoo goodly
Coursers appareled for the iusts: and when they came to the tiltes
ende, the twoo knightes mounted on the two Coursers, abidyng all
commers. The king was in the fountain and Sir Charles Brandon was in
the litter. Then suddenly with great noyse of the Trompets, entered
Sir Thomas Kneuit in a castle of cole blacke, and ouer the castell was
written, ‘The dolorous Castle,’ and so he and the erle of Essex, the
lorde Haward and other ran their courses, with the King and Sir Charles
Brandon and euer the king brake moste  speres.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>There were royal jousts held in October, 1513, the king and Lord Lisle
answering all comers. His Majesty was attended by twenty-four knights
clad in robes of purple velvet and cloth of gold, and many lances were
broken.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>In 1515 Henry, with the Marquis of Dorset, challenged all comers to a
joust, and the king “brake three and twentie speres beside attaints and
bare downe to ground a man of armes and his horse.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>In the same year on twelfth-night the king held a <i>Scharmützel</i>, being
the attack and defence of a mock fortress, at Eltham.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>Royal jousts were held again in June, 1519, at which 506 lances were
splintered.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>In the eighth year of his reign the king proclaimed solemn jousts in
honour of his sister, the Queen of Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> to extend over two
days. The tenans on the first day were the king himself, the Duke of
Suffolk, the Earl of Essex and Nicholas Carew, Esquire. The venans
numbered twelve. On the second day the king ran against Sir William
Kingston, a tall and strong knight, and unhorsed him. The apparel of
the tenans and their horses “was blacke velvet, covered all over with
braunches of honey suckels of fine flat gold of damaske, of lose worke,
every lefe of the braunch moving, the embroudery was very conning and
sumptuous.”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>

<p>The following documents occur among the Harleian MSS.:—“Justs at
Greenwich, the 20th daie of Maye, the 8th yeare of the Raigne of our
Soveraigne Ld. K. Henry VIII.” The score of each jouster is given.</p>

<p>The jousts and tourneys of the Field of the Cloth of Gold were held
on a truly magnificent scale, and, indeed, everything was done to
make them a triumphant spectacular success. The cavaliers of the
two nations, like the ladies present, vied with each other in the
richness of their dresses and appointments, and the two monarchs
greatly distinguished themselves in the tiltyard. The lists themselves
are stated to have been 150 paces long, and were placed in a plain
surrounded by a ditch. Stands were erected for the officials and
spectators, and pavilions were pitched for the use of the cavaliers
taking part. The jousting was with blunted lances, each challenger to
run eight courses. The two kings entered the enclosure on June 11th,
1520, armed at all points, at the time appointed. The horse of his
Majesty of France was trapped with purple satin broached with gold and
embroidered with raven’s plumes hatched with gold, and on his helm he
wore a lady’s sleeve. The trapper of the King of England was of cloth
of gold tissue, fringed with damask and knitted together with golden
points. In attendance on King Henry were Sir Henry Guilford, Master of
the Horse; Sir John Pechie, Governor of Calais; Sir Edmund Guilford,
General of the Forces; and Monsieur Morel, attached to his suite by
King Francis. They all wore the royal livery.</p>

<p>The jousting began, the onset was sounded, and King Henry ran against
Monsieur Grandevile, and the helm of the Frenchman was fractured. The
Duc de Vendôme ran five courses against the Duke of Suffolk, each
breaking his lance on the other’s body. After many more jousts had been
accomplished the signal to cease for the day was given, the heralds
crying “<i>Desarmée</i>” and the trumpets sounded <i>à l’hostel</i>
(to lodgings).</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 12th, ten gentlemen of the French king’s Swiss Guard
tilted against eleven of the band of Monsieur de Tremouille.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 13th, the King of France, with his aides, and King
Henry, with his following, rode at the tilt, after which there was much
jousting between the knights of France and England; and towards evening
King Francis left for Ard and the English monarch departed for his
castle of Guisnes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Thursday the French king tilted with the Earl of Devonshire
and others, and King Henry ran against Monsieur Montmorencie and Rafe
Brooke. On the Friday there was fighting at barriers, and on the
Saturday a banquet was given by the French king and his suite at the
Castle of Guisnes. A Frenchman was killed when fighting on foot.</p>

<p>On the Monday the fêtes were in abeyance, owing to a great storm, but
on the Tuesday the two kings came to the lists, armed at all points,
and jousting was resumed. Wednesday and Thursday were devoted to the
<i>mêlée</i>, and on Friday, June 22nd, “the two kings with their retinues
did battle on foot at barriers.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
The French cavaliers wore doublets of cloth of silver and purple
velvet, while those of the English were of cloth of gold and russet
velvet. The weapons were spears and swords.</p>

<p>On Saturday, after a banquet, there was again fighting at barriers,
first with spears and afterwards with two-handed swords.</p>

<p>The <i>pas d’armes</i> was followed by masks, more banqueting and the dance.
Both Hall and Holinshed describe this historic meeting.</p>

<p>Among the Ashmolean MSS. are the following concerning the Field of
the Cloth of Gold:—“<i>Ce sont les noms des princes, prellatz, et
grans seigneurs de France, qui estoient en la compaignie de Roy de
France quant le Roy</i> [<i>Henry VIII</i>] <i>Dengleterre et led’ sr le Roy</i>
[<i>François</i>] <i>sentrevyrent et ordonnerent les Iousts et Tournoys qui
sensuyvent</i>.” Prefixed to the title is a stanza of five lines inviting
to the jousts.</p>

<p>“The proclamacōn in Frenche of the Articles of the Iustes and other
feates of armes at the meeting of the aforesaid Kinges [Henry and
François] at Guisnes, proclaimed throughout the realme of France
by Thomas Benolt al’s Clarencieux King of Armes. <i>Comme ainsi soit
louange.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Imperial royal jousts were run in the month of March of the thirteenth
year of the reign, of which Hall gives an account; and there were
others in the year following.</p>

<p>On March 10th, 1524, King Henry ran a great risk of losing his life
in the tiltyard, for when jousting with Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, he
forgot to shut and clasp down the visor of his helmet. Brandon, who was
short-sighted, did not perceive this, and in his career aimed his lance
at that part of the king’s head-piece, striking it at the side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
face, unhelming his Majesty, though without causing him any injury. As
already mentioned, in a joust held on Shrove Tuesday in the year 1525
Sir Charles Bryan nearly lost an eye from a somewhat similar cause.</p>

<p>King Henry, like his friend Maximilian of Austria, is always
represented as the successful jouster, and, although his strength,
skill and good fortune are generally admitted, some explanation is
required to account for his invariable success. It has been suggested
that it may have been due in some measure to the prerogative of the
queen, by which a joust could be stopped if there should be any
probability of the king’s defeat.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“On May-day <i>anno</i> 1536 was a great jousting held at Greenwich, at
which the chief challenger was the Lord Rochford, the queen’s brother;
and the defendant was one Henry Norris, of the king’s bed-chamber, with
others. They managed their arms with great dexterity, and every course
which they ran came off with the loud applause of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>“Another solemne Challenge was proclaimed and
perfourmed by certaine English Knights, viz. Sir John
Dudley,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Sir Thomas Seimer, Sir Francis Poynings, Sir
George Carew, Anthony Kingston and Richard Cromwel. <i>Anno</i> 1540.”</p>
</div>

<p>Royal jousts were run on the thirty-first year of the reign, in
celebration of the king’s marriage with Anne of Clѐves.</p>

<p>Lacroix, in <i>Military and Religious Life in the Middle Ages</i>, pictures
the degradation of a knight convicted of dishonourable conduct, copied
from a wood-cut bearing the initials “J. A.” (Jost Amman). The culprit
is exposed on a scaffold, clad only in his shirt, his armour is broken
in pieces before him and thrown at his feet, and his spurs are cast
upon a dunghill. His shield is dragged by a cart-horse through the
mire, and the tail of his <i>destrier</i> cut off. A herald-at-arms cries
three times, “Who is there?” and each time the name of the knight is
given. The herald then cries, “No, it is not so; I see no knight, but
only a false coward.” The culprit is borne on a litter into a church,
where the burial service is read over him, and the world of chivalry
knows him no more.</p>

<p>There is no record of any royal jousts on the accession of Edward VI
to the throne, and such pastimes would seem to have been greatly in
abeyance during that short reign.</p>

<p>The same would seem to have been the case during the reign of Queen
Mary; but there were fights at barriers in 1554, when Philip II arrived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
in England. The challengers, against all comers, were Don
Fredericke de Toledo, the Lord Strange, Don Ferdinando de Toledo,
Don Francisco de Mendoça, and Garsulace de la Vega.</p>

<p>The prizes were as follows, viz.:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">“1. He who cometh forth most gallantly, though without
superfluities, shall have a rich brooch.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. The best stroke with the pike shall have a
ring with a ruby.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. The best stroke with the sword shall have a

<p class="neg-indent">4. He that fighteth most valiantly shall have a

<p class="neg-indent">5. The prize of all together in rank at the foyle

<p class="neg-indent">He that giveth a stroke with a pike from the

<p class="neg-indent">He that shall have a close gauntlet or anything

<p class="neg-indent">Whosoever shall fight and not show his sword to

<p>During the reign of Queen Elizabeth vigorous efforts were made to
revive the ancient glories of the tournament, which were for a time not
without a certain measure of success, under the auspices of the maiden
queen. Sir Henry Lee rode as the queen’s champion until advancing years
caused him to relinquish the self-imposed office in favour of the Earl
of Cumberland, who wore a glove of her Majesty’s on his helmet.</p>

<p>A drawing, from a MS., of tilting, tourney and barriers is reproduced
in Lord Dillon’s paper in the <i>Archæological Journal</i>, Vol. LV, which
affords a good deal of information regarding the detail of such combats
during the reign.</p>

<p>There were jousts and barriers on the accession of Queen Elizabeth
to the throne in 1558, in which the Duke of Norfolk and the earls of
Surrey, Warwick and Leicester took part.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The <i>fête d’armes</i> at which Henri II of France was fatally injured
was held at Paris in 1559. The tenans on the occasion were the king, the
Prince of Ferrera, the Duke of Guise and others. The course in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the accident befel was an extra one, run in the face of remonstrances
on the part of the other challengers. The cause of the injury would
seem to have been that the Comte de Montgomeri, Captain of the Scottish
Guard, failed to drop his shivered lance immediately after impact, as
he ought to have done, and the jagged end striking the king’s visor,
a splinter passed through the slit for vision and pierced his brain.
The king’s case was hopeless from the first, though he lingered in
agony for nearly a week. The king’s accidental death was not avenged
on Montgomeri at the time, but Catherine de Medici had him executed
fifteen years later. Lacroix, in <i>Military and Religious Life in the
Middle Ages</i>, gives a picture of this fatal encounter, copied from an
engraving of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Viscount Dillon, in his paper “Barriers and Foot Combats,” reproduces
a picture of Spanish officers “At Barriers” in Brussels, 1569 (after
Hogenberg). The details are interesting as showing the manner of
fighting on foot at the time.</p>

<p>As stated in the Ashmolean MS., No. 837, fol. 245, a tournament
was proclaimed at Hampton Court by Clarencieulx, King of Arms,
on Twelfth-night, <i>anno</i> 1570, to take place in the month of May
following. The MS. begins with a preamble, being a general exhortation
to revive the tournament, which “had of late fallen a sleepe.” Next
come the <i>chapitres d’armes</i> (the articles) for the tilt, tourney and
barriers. A copy of the document follows here:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p class="space-above1">Another MS. in the same collection (No. 845, fol. 164)
gives a list of the participants, with their “checques” (which are tablets for
recording the scores made). Examples of these registers are given here,
under the heading of the document in question:—</p>

<p class="blockquot center">[54 more, as above, 25 without arms.]</p>

<p>The tenans on the occasion were the Earl of Oxford, Lord Charles
Howard, Sir Henry Lee, and Christopher Hatton, a “pencioner,” and
a list of their opponents, with their “Checques,” is given in the
Ashmolean MS. No. 845, fol. 167. (<a href="#Page_128">See page 128</a>.)</p>

<p>The prize for the best lance among the tilters was “a cheyne of gold,”
which fell to the Earl of Oxford, who ran forty-two courses and
splintered thirty-two lances, a very good performance. The prize for
the tourney was a “Diamonde”; that for “barriours” a “Rubie,” which was
won by Thomas Cecil, one of the venans.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
In 1590, after the siege of Paris had been raised, King Henri IV
challenged the Duc de Mayenne to single combat, in order that by a
decisive result the calamities of France might be stayed, but nothing
came of it.</p>

<p>A tournament was held at Westminster under the leadership of Walter,
Earl of Essex, which is chiefly remarkable from the fact of its
having taken place during the night. It was on the occasion when Anne
de Montmorency, Constable of France, came to London to receive the
Order of the Garter, in June, 1572. Queen Elizabeth gave a supper in
celebration of the event, at which she presided, and in due time she
retired to her apartments. The weather being warm, however, it pleased
her Majesty to walk from her chamber on to the open terrace of the
palace, where the French duke and his suite were assembled, with many
of the English courtiers. The Earl of Essex entered the terrace quite
suddenly, accompanied by twelve gentlemen armed at all points and well
mounted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Earl and his horse were furnished with white cloth of siluer,
and the rest in white sattin, who after reuerence done to her Maiesty,
marched to the east side of the Court, and there in troope, stood
firme. Forthwith entered Edward Earle of Rutland, with a like number,
in like sort armed and apparelled all in blew; and hauing presented his
reuerence, stayed on the west end. Before either of these bands, one
Chariot was drawen, and therein a faire Damsell, conducted by an armed
Knight, who pronounced certain speeches in the French tongue, vnto
her Maiestie. These Ceremonies passed, the Queene commanded the armed
men to fall vnto fight, which they performed with great courage, and
commendation, chiefly in the Earl of Essex, a noble personage, valorous
in armes, and all other wayes of great vertue.</p>

<p>Of the Actors names in this Triumph (it seemeth) no note is kept:
yet are many of them still liuing.”</p>
</div>

<p>The ordinances and regulations which controlled the routine of a
tournament, some of them compiled for general use and others framed for
particular contests, have been repeatedly referred to in these pages;
but the method of the keeping of scores is nowhere clearly indicated,
and, indeed, is but rarely mentioned. The score was marked in strokes
by a king of arms, sometimes by a pursuivant,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
on a scoring tablet, termed a “checque,” which was tricked with
a shield of the arms of the owner, as shown on page 127. The
scoring-board itself was in the form of a parallelogram, with three
horizontal lines, the middle line projecting some distance beyond the
others, and on the projection of this middle line the number of courses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
run (usually from two to eight) were registered. The attaints were
noted on the top line; and they were often differentiated as hits on
the body or head, which had a different value in the tale.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
The middle line inside the parallelogram was for the staves well
broken, and the bottom line for those “ill-broken”—that is, broken
within a foot of the head of the lance or on the tilt, on the
adversary’s saddle, etc.—these being deducted from the score or
disallowed. The proportion in the number of attaints varied greatly,
though on the average it would appear that the misses made in jousting
at the tilt (i.e. when the jousters failed to touch each other in
their careers) were greater in number than the hits made; while in
jousting “at the wide” the proportion of attaints was much greater. The
registration was done by vertical strokes on the horizontal lines.</p>

<p>As many as ten jousting cheques have been found, which help to a
knowledge as to how the scoring was managed, though more light is
needed on the subject.</p>

<p>The rules and regulations concerning the conducting of tournaments in
Tudor times were based on those framed in 1466 by John Tiptoft, Earl of
Worcester, Constable of England, which are given in our <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>;
but there is no rule among them directly mentioned concerning the method
of scoring the points. There are, however, pictures of the scoring
cheques, reproduced by Mr. ffoulkes in his paper in <i>Archæologia</i>,
Vol. LXIII, Plate IV, Nos. 2, 3, which appear at the ends of two of
the versions of the Tiptoft rules; viz. those in Harl. MS. 2413, fol.
16, and Ashmole MS. 763, fol. 149. Two cheques out of the fifty-six in
Ashmole MS. 845, fol. 164, are reproduced on our Fig. 1. They are those
of the Earl of Oxford and Charles Howard, being registers of their
scores at the passage of arms which was proclaimed by Clarencieulx in
1570.</p>

<p>This somewhat intricate subject can only be lightly touched upon in
these pages; but we may refer any of our readers who may wish to pursue
the subject further to Lord Dillon’s paper, “Tilting in Tudor Times,”
published in the <i>Archæological Journal</i>, Vol. LV, and to that written
by Mr. Charles ffoulkes in <i>Archæologia</i>, LXIII, entitled “Jousting
Cheques of the Sixteenth Century.”</p>

<p>Three writers on certain features in the routine of a tournament are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
mentioned in the last-named monograph, <i>The Romance of Three King’s
Sons</i>, written about the end of the fifteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
from which the following extract is given:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“All these thinges donne thei were embatailed
eche ageynste the othir and the corde drawen ageynste eche partie, and
whan the tyme was, the cordes were cutte and the Trumpettis blew up
for euery man to do his deuoir. And for to assertayne you more of the
Tournay there was on eche side a stake, and at eache stake two Kynges
of Armes, with penne, and Inke, and paper, to write the names of all of
them that were yolden, for they shold no more Tournay.”</p>

<p>This refers to the <i>mêlée</i>, not the joust.</p>

<p>King René d’Anjou, in <i>Traicte de la forme et Devis d’ung Tournoi</i>,
gives an illustration of a <i>mêlée</i> in which the attendants are seen
cutting the cords with axes, but there are no kings of arms present
noting the score.</p>

<p>Another reference occurs in the account given in the Landsdowne MS.
285 of the combat between the Bastard of Burgundy and Lord Scales in
1466, a contest which has been already described on these pages. It is
entitled <i>The Ordinaunce of kepyng of the Feelde</i>, and runs—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“... At ev’y corner a Kyng of Armes crownyd and
an Harauld or Pursevaunte within the seide feelde, for reporte makyng
of actes doon within the same: Garter and othir Kynges of Armes and
Hauraldes to be sett in the scaffolde before the Kyng on the right
hande of the staire of the Kynges place judiciall’ to make report
generall’ and to marke all that should be doon in the seide feelde.”</p>

<p>And we may infer that a score of the points, for and against, was kept
on the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Hall, in his narrative of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, states
definitely that the scores of the combatants were marked down by the
proper officials, English and French.</p>

<p>The Duc d’Alençon and three French gentlemen, with the earls of Sussex
and Leicester, challenged all comers, in 1551, to fight at barriers,
and they had forty-five opponents.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Jousts were run at Westminster, in conjunction with a great pageant,
on January 22nd, 1581, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth. The fêtes
extended over several days, and many lances were broken at the tilting.
The crowd was so great at the pageant that many citizens were maimed
and some killed. Those taking part in the tilting were Henry Gray,
Sir Thomas Perot, Anthony Cooke, Thomas Radcliffe, Robert and Francis
Knolles, Rafe Bowes, Thomas Kelwaie, George Goring, William Tresham,
Robert Alexander, Edward Dennie, Hercules Meantus, Edward Moore,
Richard Skipwith, Richard Ward, Edward Digbie, Henry Nowell and Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Brunkerd. During the running Sir Henry Lee entered the tiltyard as The
Unknown and, after breaking six lances, retired again. The challengers
each ran six courses against all comers. A <i>Scharmützel</i>, being the
attack and defence of a mock fortress on which cannon were mounted,
took place later, and this was followed by the tourney and barriers.
Taking part in these were the Earl of Arundel, Lord Windsor, Sir Philip
Sidney and Fulke Greville, Esquire.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>A tournament was held on the 15th May following, as mentioned
in Ashmole MS. No. 845, fol. 166, a copy of which follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

the earls of Sussex and Leicester, the Count S. Aignon, Messires Chamuallan
and Bacqueuile. The venans were led by Lord Thomas Howard.</p>

<p>In 1606, in the reign of James I, there was a fight at barriers in
celebration of the ill-fated marriage of the Earl of Essex. Sixteen
combatants fought on each side, first singly and then in threes. One
party was led by the Duke of Lennox, the other by the Earl of Sussex.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Another fight at barriers took place on Twelfth-night, 1610, when
Henry Prince of Wales, with six aides, met sixty-five defendants at
Whitehall. The weapons were pikes and single swords, and the prince,
then in his sixteenth year, is stated to have greatly distinguished
himself.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Harleian MS., III, 215, 4888, 20, is a general challenge at tilt,
tourney, and barriers, “signed Lenox, Southampton, Pembroke,
Montgumbray,” dated 1612. It was in defence of these propositions—“1.
That in Service of Ladyes, Knights have no free-will. 2. That it is
Beautie maintains the World in valour. 3. That noe fare Ladie was ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
false. 4. That none can be perfectlye wife but Lover.” The challenge
was addressed, “To all honourable men, Men at Armes, and Knight
Adventurers of hereditarie note, ＆ examplarie noblesse, that for most
memorable actions doe wield either Sword or Launce in quest of glorie.”</p>

<p>Ashmole MS. No. 837, fol. 129-32, gives a long account of “The manner
of first cominge into the Tiltyard” of Charles Prince of Wales in the
year 1619. It is interesting from many points of view, and we reproduce
it here nearly <i>in extenso</i>. Like all accounts of the tournament of
the period but little information is given of the martial sports
themselves, though a great deal is written concerning the dresses,

and mighty Prince Charles Prince of Wales sonne and heir apparent of
our Souereign Lo: Kinge James on Friday the xxiiijᵗʰ of March 1619 wͨͪ
was in the most princely and Royall manner that had been sene many
yeares before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[fol. 129 b]</div>

<p>The day and tyme drawing neare the Tiltyard at Whitehall was
prepared wᵗʰ many scaffoldes on both sides ＆ the vpper end where stood
his Majestie himself wᵗʰ many other great estates and on the one side
sate in a place prepared of purpose at the vpper end the Embassadors
on the other side next to Sᵗ James parke gate was erected a most rich
＆ stately Pauillion of green yellow ＆ white damaske laid on wᵗʰ broad
lace of siluer ＆ gold wᵗʰ a very deep valence of cloth of silver
frendged about wᵗʰ a deep freng of gold ＆ siluer garnished about wᵗʰ
The princes Armes ＆ badges. on the top of it was set an Eglet in her
nest loking vp at the sonne wᵗʰ this motto at it Nec Degener heres. All
wᵗʰ being ready ＆ exceedingly well cleared ＆ ordered by Sʳ Edw; Zouch
Kᵗ Marshall. The E: of Arrundell being appointed to be Erle Marshall
of England for that day about 12 of the clok came into the Tiltyard on
horseback attended by diuers of his owne gent on foot wᵗʰ truncheons
in their handes on whome likewise attended the Kᵗ Marshall ＆ all the
officers of Armes in their Coates of Armes on horseback vntill his
Majestie was ready to come thither. All things beinge / in a readines
＆ the tiltyard in a very good order his Lordship attended wᵗʰ the Kt
Marshall Clarenceux ＆ Norry ＆ all the heralds ＆ pursuiantes of armes
rode to Denmarke house to fetch the Prince his highnes and let him
vnderstand that his Majestie were [sic] redy ＆ expected his coming
wherevpon he proceeded in manner followinge.</p>

<p>First marched on foote all the Princes band of his Artillery yard
led by their captaine, Mʳ Conisby. next to them went many of the Kᵗ
Marshalls men well suited wᵗʰ truncheons in their handes before their
Master who for the most part coasted vp ＆ downe to keep the street ＆
passage clene from people. /</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reason why the Princes trumpets did intercede betw:
the officers of Armes and the Prince and had place of them ＆ the Kinges
trompetts was because they were part of the Princes Show, and therefore
not thought fitt to be diuided.</div>

<p>Then six of the Kings Trumpetters sounding the sergᵗ
Trumpeter wᵗʰ his mace before them riding.</p>

<p>Next to them the pursuiantes ＆ heraldes of Armes wᵗʰ the two
provinciall kings of Armes Clarenceux ＆ Norry vnto all whome the
Prince his highnes had very bountefully distributed to euery of them
9 yardes of rich taffata of his coullors vist 3 yardes of white 3
yardes of yellow ＆ three yardes of green all fringed very richly wᵗʰ a
deep frenge of silver ＆ gold spangled and likewise to each of them a
white Bever hatt wᵗʰ a fair gold ＆ siluer band and larg plumes of his
coullors. /</p>

<p>Then followed 6 of the Princes Trumpettes very richly clad in grene
veluet coats laid wᵗʰ gold ＆ silure lace ＆ white Beruers ＆ fethers

<p>Next rode the Erie Marshall wᵗʰ his marshalls rod</p>

<p>Then the Prince his highnes alone all armed in white armour ＆
bravely mounted on horseback wᵗʰ wonderfull rich caparisans ＆ plumes
attended by diuers of his cheife gent on foot most richly araied in

<p>And after him followed 3 spare horses wᵗʰ plumes ＆ rich embrodered

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
The tournament lingered long in Germany.</p>

<p>The decline of armour had become acute by the close of the sixteenth
century, and to this there were many contributory causes. Far too much
stress has been laid on the extended use of firearms as being the main
reason for this, though the ever-increasing penetrative force of the
musket-ball had tended greatly to diminish the value of steel harness
as a sure means of defence. As a matter of fact, full armour could not
be constantly worn during a long campaign without injury to health,
besides being a great clog to mobility on the march and in the field.
Another potent factor towards the disuse of armour lay in the fact that
harness for the soldiery was made in certain standard or arbitrary
sizes, each piece being numbered, so that the suits rarely fitted
individual cases. They were thus apt to chafe the bodies of the wearers
and to cause sores beyond endurance, so that pieces of armour were
frequently cast away on the march, all penalties notwithstanding. The
man-at-arms of an earlier age became the pistolier, <i>Landsknecht</i> and
cuirassier of later times.</p>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century another decided change took place in
the form of the breastplate, which followed the cut of the doublet of
civil life, in the gradual shortening of the waist, and body-armour
became stumpy and inelegant.</p>

<p>The latest phase of cap-à-pie armour is well illustrated by a harness
in the Musée d’Artillerie, Paris, which was presented by the Republic
of Venice to Louis XIV, in 1688. It is very uncouth in form. During the
last half of the century plate-armour gradually disappears, the pikemen
being the last infantry arm to employ it. A “pair of plates” were the
last pieces worn, and, except in the case of the cuirassiers, they also
were abandoned in favour of the buff coat pure and simple.</p>

<p>After a career of six centuries, the tourney had practically run its
course, and had now become almost a thing of the past. Its influence on
the ages had been in the main for good, in restraining the licence of
troublous times and in inculcating a respect for women. It had fostered
a spirit of courtesy, honour and chivalry, sentiments which extended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
themselves far beyond its borders, Sainte-Palaye remarks, “<i>Chevalerie
est la fontaine de courtoisie, ce qui arrose le reste du monde</i>”;
but as the means for luxury increased, and as time rolled on, the
old simplicity fell away and corruption set in, and though the forms
remained the spirit had fled. All <i>raisons d’être</i> for the tourney
beyond those of exercise and pastime had long since passed away,
through the continuous decline in the importance of the man-at-arms in
warfare, the ever-increasing efficiency of firearms, and the necessity
for greater mobility of armies in the field.</p>

<p class="space-above2">The history of the tournament would not be
complete without some account of the revivals attempted in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They lack, however, a sense of
reality, being, in fact, merely more or less well-staged plays.</p>

<p>The Eglington Tournament, held in Ayrshire in 1839, though a good deal
based on Sir Walter Scott’s legend, the “Gentle and Joyous Passage of
Arms of Ashby de la Zouche,”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
was, in many respects, also a revival of a <i>pas d’armes</i> of Tudor
times. It was carried through in the face of some ridicule, much
discouragement and many difficulties; but all obstacles were gallantly
surmounted by the enthusiasm, tenacity and liberality of the Earl of
Eglingtoun and his coadjutors. The very elements were against it, for
torrents of rain fell frequently during its course, converting the
lists into a pond, spoiling the decorations of the stands, and wrecking
the temporary banqueting-hall erected at the castle. The training
of the horses in so short a time presented the greatest practical
difficulty, for here the promoters were at a great disadvantage
as against the early and persistent drilling of the chargers for
employment in the <i>fêtes d’armes</i> of the olden times. The lists at
Eglington Park measured 600 yards by 250, the tilt or barrier being 300
yards long, running down the centre. A handsome pavilion was pitched
for the use and comfort of the Queen of Beauty (Lady Seymour) and her
train of ladies. There were other tents for the accommodation of the
knights taking part, and a grand stand was erected for the presiding
queen, her maidens, and the guests of the promoters. Seats were placed
at the eastern end of the arena for about two thousand spectators.
Thirty-five knights took part in this passage of arms, and among them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
were Prince Louis Napoleon, the Marquis of Waterford, Earls Eglingtoun,
Craven and Cassilis, Lords Alford, Glenyon, Cranstoun, A. Seymour, W.
Beresford, Drumlanrig and Maidstone. Lord Gage and Sir Charles Lamb
acted as Marshals of the List, the rôle of King of Arms being sustained
by the Marquis of Londonderry. There were several rehearsals, the
last of which took place on July 13th. The first to joust at the tilt
on that occasion were the Earl of Eglingtoun and the Lord Cranstoun.
Several courses were run by these champions and two lances were broken.
Other encounters followed with varying fortune. The “Lord of the
Tournament” was the Earl of Eglingtoun; the Judge of the Lists, Lord
Saltoun; and the inevitable Jester, a Mr. M’Ian from London.</p>

<p>The procession was arranged by Sir Charles Lamb and Lord Saltoun. The
tournament began on August 28th, 1839. The morning was fine, and by one
o’clock some ten thousand persons had assembled, and crowds continued
to arrive. A pitiless rain much delayed the starting of the procession
from the castle, and it was sadly shorn of its fair proportions;
for the Queen of Beauty and her maidens had to betake themselves to
carriages instead of riding on horseback as intended. The procession
reached the lists in the afternoon, about three, in a much bedraggled
condition, and the presiding queen, her attendants and the castle
house-party, took their seats on the grand stand prepared for them.
After flourishes of trumpets, the rules, regulations and limitations
for the guidance of the proceedings were proclaimed by a herald. The
number of courses to be run by each pair of jousters was settled at
three, or at most four. The harnesses employed, some of them collected
in England, the rest abroad, varied greatly in regard to period: the
armour of the Earl of Craven is amusingly stated to have been worn
by an ancestor of the Earl’s (Baron Hilton) at the field of Cressy.
Reinforcing pieces were employed.</p>

<p>On the weather clearing a little, the scene presented was a brilliant
one. There were the knights armed at all points, and their horses
gaily trapped in cloth painted in rich colours with their arms and
devices. Merging with the rich dresses of the ladies, they offered
a fine and moving spectacle. The <i>pas d’armes</i> commenced with the
quintain, after which jousting at the tilt began. The tilting was far
from satisfactory, for the attaints achieved were very few in number.
This was owing to the lack of skill on the part of the riders, the
insufficient training of the horses, and the mistaken notion that the
careers were to be run at the gallop instead of at an amble. The first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
joust was run between the “Knight of the Swan” (the Hon. Mr.
Jerningham) and the “Knight of the Golden Lion” (Captain J. O.
Fairlie). They took up positions for their careers, and the trumpets
sounded the onset. There were no attaints in the first three courses,
but in the fourth the Knight of the Golden Lion broke his lance on
the shield of his adversary. The second challenge was by the Earl of
Eglingtoun to the Marquis of Waterford, and in the first course both
lances were splintered. There was no attaint in the second, but in the
third the Earl again splintered his lance. The third joust was between
Sir Francis Hopkins and R. J. Lechmere, Esq. In the first encounter Sir
Francis shivered his lance, and in the second both lances were broken,
but that of Sir Francis was disallowed as being “ill-broken.” In the
fourth career Sir Francis again shivered his lance. The fourth tilt
was between the Lords Glenlyon and Alford. There were no attaints in
the first two courses, but in the third Lord Alford broke his spear.
Next came combats on foot at barriers with two-handed swords, after
which jousting was resumed. The last joust of the day was between the
Marquis of Waterford and Lord Alford. The first course was without
attaint, and in the second a hit was disallowed, the lance breaking
just above the head; but in the third the Marquis shivered his lance
“as it ought to be broken.” During all this the rain fell at intervals
and with increasing violence, which sadly marred the brilliancy of the
scene, and the banquet had to be abandoned owing to the wrecking of
the temporary banqueting-hall by the storm. In the evening there were
combats with broadswords in the drawing-room of the castle, and a duel
between Prince Louis Napoleon and Mr. Lamb is stated to have afforded
some excellent sword-play. The tournament was to have been continued
on the following Thursday, but the weather was so boisterous that the
completion of the <i>pas d’armes</i> was postponed to Friday, August 30th.
The weather was fine and sunny, and the procession to the lists was
this time complete in all its parts, the queen and her ladies being on
horseback. The first tilt of the day was between the Lords Glenlyon and
Alford, and there was but one attaint in the three courses. The Earl of
Craven and Captain Fairlie then took up positions for their careers.
Both lances were shivered in the first course, in the second there was
no attaint, but in the third the Earl again shivered his lance. This
was the best joust of the tournament. To be brief, there were six more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
jousts, making altogether nineteen courses, and but two attaints.
Running at the Ring followed, and a <i>mêlée</i> brought the tournament to
a close. The combatants in the latter were—The Lord of the Tournament
(Earl of Eglingtoun), the Knight of the Dragon (Marquis of Waterford),
the Black Knight (W. L. Gilmour, Esq.), and the Knight of the Gael
(Lord Glenlyon): <i>against</i> the Knight of the Black Lion (Viscount
Alford), the Knight of the Red Rose (R. J. Lechmere, Esq.), the
Knight of the White Rose (Charles Lamb, Esq.), and the Knight of the
Swan (Hon. H. Jerningham). Mr. Jerningham was hurt in the wrist by
a sword-stroke in the <i>mêlée</i>, but this was the only casualty worth
recording during the tournament. Several of the knights were unseated,
and in one case both horse and rider fell, a few bruises resulting.
The prize was awarded to the Earl of Eglingtoun. It was a coronet,
with which the Queen of Beauty gracefully crowned him, in the manner
of the Lady Rowena in the lists at Ashby de la Zouche. There was a
banquet in the evening, at which Lord Eglingtoun expressed the hope
that this attempt at a revival of the tournament might result in its
being continued among the nobility and gentry of these islands. This
pious wish, however, failed to be realised, the very ethics of the
institution being so totally at variance with the sentiment prevailing
in modern times. The banquet was followed by a dance.</p>

<h3>THE TOURNAMENT AT BRUSSELS IN 1905</h3>

<p>In marked contrast to the Eglingtoun Tournament, in the way of
accuracy of detail and historic truth, was the <i>pas d’armes</i> in the
Rathausplatz, at Brussels, in 1905, held nearly three-quarters of a
century later. This revival in what was once Burgundian territory was
most appropriate, the more so as it took place in Brussels itself.
It was in the Rathausplatz there, one of the most striking sites in
Europe, that the Comte de Charolais, afterwards Charles the Bold,
ran in his first tournament in 1452. The Comte was then but eighteen
years of age, and tilted in as many courses on that occasion, breaking
sixteen lances “as they ought to be broken”—a very good performance,
viz. sixteen attaints out of eighteen runs. It was this tournament,
held in the city of Brussels some four and a half centuries before, in
the reign of Philippe le Bon, that was selected for reconstruction in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the months of July and August, 1905.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Charles was born in November, 1433, and the tournament in question was
held in commemoration of the anniversary of his birthday. He was killed
in battle on the fatal field of Nancy in 1477. In the month of August
of the same year his daughter and heiress, the Princess Maria, was
wedded to Maximilian of Austria, and the brilliant traditions of the
tournament passed over to his court.</p>

<p>The collection of illuminated MSS. in the Burgundian Library, now
transferred to the National Library at Brussels, with the <i>Armorial
de la Toison d’Or</i> and other Burgundian records, now in the National
Library at Paris,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
furnish reliable and inexhaustible material for the correct staging of
a modern revival of a tournament on the lines of one of the fifteenth
century. It is thus no wonder that the reconstruction, in the summer
of 1905, of the <i>pas d’armes</i> of 1452 was attended by such success
as to prove of great educational value. The middle of the fifteenth
century was, perhaps, the most picturesque period of the tourney: its
rich weapons and armour, the caparisons of the horses, the arms of the
champions and others, the lists, the music, and even the very musical
instruments of the period, together with the sumptuous accessories of
the brilliant Burgundian Court, were reproduced in 1905 to a marvel.</p>

<p>The reconstruction, as presented at Brussels, began with the entry of
Duke Philip of Burgundy into the lists in the Rathausplatz, with a
splendid train of the ladies of his court, the Marshal of the Lists,
the King of Arms (Jean Lefébre de Saint-Remy, the reputed writer of the
<i>Armorial de la Toison d’Or</i>), the Comte de Charolais, with his five
jousting associates and many historic figures of the camp and tourney
throughout Christendom, the four judges of the tournament, heralds,
pursuivants, etc. The Duke having taken his seat as supreme umpire on
the gaily decked tribune prepared for him, the trumpets sounded and the
jousting began. Many courses were run in character. This was followed
by the quintain, and afterwards by combats on foot and a <i>mêlée</i>;
then the prizes were presented. Figures of the knights of 1452, such
as those of the Comte de Charolais, Jacques de Lalain and Fredrich
de Renesse, were faithfully reproduced in all their details. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
excellent post-cards were published in Belgium, picturing some of the
principal scenes of the tournament. <a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII (1)</a> depicts the Comte de
Charolais armed at all points for the <i>mêlée</i>, and <a href="#PLATE_XII_2">Plate XII (2)</a>
Jean de Clèves. The <i>fêtes d’armes</i> and its rehearsals extended over several weeks.</p>

<h3>“TRIUMPH” HELD AT EARL’S COURT, LONDON, ON JULY
<span class="smcap">11th</span>, 1912</h3>

<p>The object of the promoters of this revival was to reproduce an
Elizabethan tournament of about the year 1580, such an one as is
described in this chapter. This idea was very creditably carried out,
though falling short of the Brussels reproduction of 1905 in the
matters of technique and minuteness and correctness of detail. It
must be remembered, however, that in 1580 the tournament, then itself
a revival in England, had reached an advanced stage of decadence,
and that the materials available for reconstruction are scanty and
uncertain, as contrasted with the ample records of the century
preceding. The Earl’s Court reproduction is stated to have been devised
by Mrs. George Cornwallis-West and Mr. Seymour Lucas, <span class="smcap">r.a.</span>,
with the technical assistance of Mr. (now Sir) Guy Laking. The stage
management of the play was in the competent hands of Mr. (now Sir)
Frank R. Benson. It is interesting to see so many historic names and
titles, corresponding with those of Tudor times, borne by the jousters
at Earl’s Court. The rôle of Marshal of the Lists was sustained by Lord
Lonsdale, and the judges were Lords Shrewsbury and Talbot, Essex, and
Dudley, with Major-General Brocklehurst. The Queen of Beauty was the
Viscountess Curzon.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The procession to the arena was headed by
trumpeters and four pursuivants, marching on foot; then rode the
marshal, armed at all points, with the herald (Sir F. R. Benson). The
four judges, clad in black robes, followed, their esquire (Sir Guy
Laking) bearing the umpire’s bâton. After their entry into the lists
the trumpets again sounded and the Queen of Beauty, with her train of
maidens, all mounted on palfreys, gaily decorated with roses, each
led by a henchman, rode into the arena. The Queen was attended by an
esquire, and her palfrey was caparisoned in silk. She was clad in a
ruff, a robe sparkling with diamonds, and a long mantle.</p>

The knights were arranged in trios, each cavalier preceded by an
esquire, bearing his lance, and followed by other esquires. The
first champion was the Duke of Marlborough; his motto was <i>Fiel pero
desdichado</i>, his colours a dark blue, and his proof armour was etched
with gold. The second was Lord Craven; his motto was <i>Virtus in actione
consistet</i>, his colours green, and he wore the famous armour made for
Philip II of Spain. Lord Compton completed the first trio, and his
motto was <i>Je ne cherche qu’un</i>. The second trio followed, and all
did homage to the Queen of Beauty, now seated on her throne. The herald
then proclaimed that the six knights would joust at the tilt, for a
rich and noble prize. The Lord Chrichton and the Duke of Marlborough
were the first to joust, and five courses were run by each pair. On
completion the verdict of the Queen of Beauty was that the Duke had
well jousted, but that Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, whose motto was <i>Ferro
non gladio</i>, had jousted best, and he received the prize, viz. a gold
cup of the value of £600, from her hands. The tilt was then removed and
a <i>mêlée</i> followed, in which twelve knights were engaged. There was,
of course, a banquet in the evening followed by a dance.</p>

<p>There was also a revival at Rome.</p>

<p>There now only remains the judicial duel to be described, an
institution which had much affinity with the tournament, and which,
indeed, formed an integral part of it, both in sentiment and fact. This
important branch of the subject is dealt with at some length in the
next chapter.</p>

<h3>TRIAL BY COMBAT, ITS SCOPE AND HISTORY</h3>

<p>Curiously interlinked with the procedure of the law courts, forming,
indeed, an integral part of the law of the land, was the judicial duel;
an institution applying to both civil and criminal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>It was allowed in certain cases, such as on a civil writ of right for
the recovery of land, and in criminal charges of treason or felony
on an appellant making a sworn declaration before a judge. This law,
though falling greatly into disuse after the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
remained on the statute book until early in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Among the Ashmolean, Harleian and Cottonian MSS. are many tracts,
treatises and other documents relating to the laws and manner of
conducting judicial duels, with other matter concerning these combats;
and abstracts from the MSS. are given in Appendices <a href="#APPENDIX_E">E</a>,
<a href="#APPENDIX_F">F</a>, and <a href="#APPENDIX_G">G</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>The custom of trial by combat or legal duel, the ordeal of battle, was
introduced into England by the Normans.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
As far as can be ascertained it was unknown to the Anglo-Saxons, though
the ordeal of hot water appears in one of Ine’s laws;<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
and, indeed, trial by ordeal appears repeatedly among the laws of the
Anglo-Saxon kings. The principle involved was the same in both cases,
viz. that the Almighty would not remain indifferent when solemnly
invoked, but would intervene miraculously so that the ends of justice
might be furthered. The simple faith of the times would act as a
deterrent to appeals to the judgment of God and would thus tend to
limit the number of cases. The consciousness of innocence or guilt
would also contribute towards the vindication of the cause of justice
in actual combat.</p>

<p>The proofs by fire and water (<i>vulgaris purgatio</i>), holding, carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
or walking over hot iron or heated plough-shares (<i>ferri candentis
judicium</i>), being thrown into deep water, bound hand and foot, may be
said roughly to have preceded that by judicial combat; but they form
quite another and earlier branch of the subject. The number of cases
given in history of these earlier forms of ordeal which defendants are
stated to have passed through triumphantly is considerable, but most of
them must surely be either apocryphal, or the intensity of the ordeals
themselves was much exaggerated.</p>

<p>Ordeal by combat is found among the laws of nearly all the German
tribes; and it flourished greatly in France until cases of more than
suspected miscarriage of justice brought it into disrepute. An edict
passed at Lyons in the year 501 established the institution as a
regular form of trial. It appears among the ancient laws of the Swedes
and Lombards.</p>

<p>In civil cases a claimant would declare that some ancestor of his had
been in seisin of certain property but had been unlawfully deprived of
it by another, and he would offer battle to the “tenant,” as the owner
was then called, for its restitution, by the body of a champion. The
tenant, or defendant, could then choose between an appeal to the Grand
Assize, an inquest where the question of right is determined by the
verdict of neighbours,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
in which institution may be traced the germ of the more modern jury;
or to the ordeal of battle, in his own body or by champion. No one was
compelled to defend his seisin of a free tenement by battle, though
a claimant could offer combat in the lists, which, however, might be
refused by a defendant. When a civil court ordered a combat it was
fought on foot in a small circular or oblong enclosure, similar to
that used in the foot-fighting, with shields and staves (bastons) at
a <i>pas d’armes</i> of the fifteenth century. The course of procedure in
criminal cases for the most part differed widely from that followed in
civil cases and was under quite another jurisdiction; and it largely
consisted of accusations made against the honour of certain persons,
or of alleged treason. It was customary for an accuser to justify his
charge by an offer of single combat in the lists, “God showing the
right”; and such a mode of settlement was greatly in unison with the
chivalric spirit of the age. To bring such a matter to an issue an
accuser offered battle by throwing down his glove, which when lifted
by a defendant signified that the challenge was accepted. The king was
appealed to, and, in the event of the case being remitted to the ordeal
of battle, he assigned the place and day for the combat. He further, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
consultation with the constable and marshal, decided on the
preliminaries, the conditions of battle to be observed being regulated
in accordance with fixed ordinances, which in England were drawn up by
the constable for the time being. The combat would be on horseback,
fighting <i>à outrance</i>, with lance and sword, in lists similar to those
erected for the tourney. Charges of homicide or murder might in this
country be remitted to the ordeal of battle, with shields and bastons
and in civil garments. Should an accused or claimant fail to appear in
the lists on the day appointed he could be outlawed.</p>

<p>The judicial duel may be regarded as the prototype or parent of the
chivalrous duel on foot at a <i>pas d’armes</i>.</p>

<p>The custom never took deep root in England, though during the reign
of King Henry II, when the monarchy had become more settled, and in
the times of his immediate successors Richard and John, disputes
relating to the possession of land were very rife, greatly owing to
the fact that so many manors and smaller holdings had been forcibly
and illegally riven from their rightful owners in the preceding reigns
since the Conquest, by the barons and their adherents. The ordinary
law courts experienced great difficulty in dealing with them on the
principles set forth in the written statutes, which then as always
inclined to favour the man in possession; and the rough and ready
settlement by combat was ordered, more especially in cases where there
was a hopeless conflict of testimony between litigants and no means of
getting at the truth by the evidence of any living witnesses.</p>

<p>The actual number of judicial duels would seem to have been small in
England, for in the great majority of cases before the courts the
judges managed to declare that there should be no combat.</p>

<p>Certain persons were excused from battle. They comprised the citizens
of London, who were exempted by charter; the clergy; “<i>sexagenarii</i>”;
and “those blind by accident after issue joined.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
Women were not exempted by law and, indeed, sometimes fought.</p>

<p>The early ordinances, forms and manner of carrying out this
singular institution in practice in England are given in <i>Origines
Juridiciales</i>.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
A short and imperfect summary follows on these pages:</p>

<h3>TRIAL BY COMBAT IN CIVIL CASES</h3>

<p>In cases where this mode of trial for the possession of certain lands
or other property was allowed by the court, and a combat followed, the
further tenure of a holding in question would depend solely on the principle
of battle, without any later appeal to the Grand Assize being permissible.</p>

<p>Before a trial by combat could be sanctioned the claimant in the suit
was summoned before the court with his champion, who, once fixed upon,
could not be changed, unless in the case of his “natural death” taking
place in the interval before battle; but should he die “by his own
fault, the lord shall lose his Sute.”</p>

<p>The defendant might either defend his cause in person or fight by
deputy; but should he elect to be represented by champion and the one
chosen should die in the interim it would become a question to be
argued before the court as to whether or not the defendant should be
allowed to appoint another in his place. The challenger or demandant
was not allowed to fight in person.</p>

<p>Should the defendant, the “tenant,” be vanquished in the fight, then
“the lord shall lose the land and the claimant shall have it”; but
it often happened that a champion had been hired for some fee or
reward, and if this should be proved the principal would lose his
suit. Some particulars are given of a case of this kind<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
“betwixt Thomas fitz Hugh de Staunton and the prior of Lenton for the advousen
of the church of Harlaston, in Northamptonshire.” Both parties to the
suit were represented by champion, the appellant being a churchman,
and they fought on foot in the lists, armed with bastons (i.e.
polygonally-shaped maces or cudgels of heavy wood, tipped with horn:
“basculi cornuti, bastons cornuz”).<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<h3>TRIAL BY COMBAT IN CASES CRIMINAL</h3>

<p>This was conducted much on the lines of knightly usage in combats
on horseback <i>à outrance</i>, except, as already stated, in charges of
homicide or murder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>The cartel setting forth the charge, subscribed to on oath, was laid
before the judges of chivalry by the appellant, the accuser, stating
that “he was ready to maintain the same with his body.” This document
was then considered by the judges, and should combat be allowed it was
served on the accused, the defendant; and if within an interval of six
weeks he had not responded, judgment was registered against him by
default, his coat-armour being reversed or ignominiously fastened under
his horse’s tail, in disgrace.</p>

<p>Should the accused stand on his defence both parties were cited to
appear in the field outside the lists, which were quadrangular in form
with a gate at each end. Judgment seats were provided for the constable
and marshal, and at their feet were stationed a competent number of
experienced knights and “a doctor or two of civil laws,” all for the
advice and assistance of the court.</p>

<p>The appellant first came to the gate at the right end of the lists,
clad in complete armour, attended by his esquires, and the constable
and marshal demanded of him through their herald his name and purpose.
On his answering, he was conducted into the lists by a knight and
herald and placed before the judgment seat on the right hand. A similar
course of procedure was adopted towards the defendant, who was placed
facing the accuser on the left hand.</p>

<p>The choice of the weapons stipulated in the cartel lay with the
defendant, and the advisory knights inspected and measured them for
both sides, so that there might be no inequality in that respect
between the parties; and the knights must answer for it that there be
no enchantment or magic practised on either side.</p>

<p>It was then demanded of the principals if their purpose held, and they
affirmed the same, laying their hands on the Evangelists. The appellant
then briefly rehearsed the terms of the cartel of defiance, making oath
as to its truth, after which the defendant affirmed also on oath his
denial of the charge.</p>

<p>These preliminaries over the parties prepared for battle, which was
to continue from sunrise to sunset; the herald crys, “Let them goe
together,” and the onset is sounded by trumpet call.</p>

<p>Should the appellant not overcome the defendant during the day the
latter was deemed guiltless, and the procurator of the constable and
marshal publicly proclaimed the fact: but to secure what was termed
“a perfect victory,” a confession of guilt by one of the parties was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
necessary. The cartel was then sealed with the common seal in testimony
that the combat had duly taken place, and all the legal formalities
been observed.</p>

<p>A picture of a legal duel on a murder charge, of the reign of Henry
III, has been preserved, and the names of the combatants are written
upon it. It has been reproduced by Hewitt in <i>Ancient Armour and
Weapons of War</i>,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
and the parties are represented fighting. A gallows is depicted in
the group with the vanquished combatant hanging from it. This was no
knightly battle—the champions fought on foot in their civil dresses of
leather or cloth, bare-headed, with quadrangular bowed shields, and
bastons garnished at their heads with spurs, like those of a pick.</p>

<p>Rules and ordinances for the regulation of judicial combats in France
were promulgated by Phillip IV, surnamed le Bel. An abridged account of
them follows:—<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Four things to be established before the Gage of Battle may be adjudged.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. The institution applies to grave suspicion in
cases of murder, manslaughter, treason or the like offences.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Every true man if he knows himself to be
accused to present himself before the court without waiting to be cited
or summoned.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. That no gage be granted for accusations of
theft or robbery.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. On a gage of battle being granted the
appellant to furnish particulars as to where the alleged wicked deed
was done, the name of the party dead; or full details of the treason
alleged to have been committed.</p>
</div>

<p>Should the judge allow the combat the advocate of the appellant is to
lay the case before the court in sober terms; but should the defendant
deny the charge the appellant must say that, although he cannot prove
it by witnesses or other evidence, yet he can avouch it in his own body
or by another for him, in an enclosed field in presence of the king.</p>

<p>The appellant is to throw down his glove and retain counsel for arms,
horse, etc., necessary for the gage of battle. The defendant may reply
to the accusation that the appellant has falsely and maliciously lied;
and that in his defence, by the help of God and our Lady, he will
avouch his innocence with his body or by some other for him; and that
he will be ready on the day and at the place fixed upon for the combat.
Then he is to take up the gage thrown down by the appellant, and a
decision will be given by the count as to whether trial by battle will
be allowed or not.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>If recourse to a duel be permitted the parties will swear to be on the
ground on the day appointed; the combat to be overlooked by wise and
honest men, clerks, knights, and esquires, without favour to either
party; but should either appellant or defendant fail to keep his tryst
he shall be proclaimed recreant, and afterwards arrested.</p>

<p>Regulations as to the procedure for the combat follows:—the parties to
bring sustenance for themselves and their horses for the day; the lists
to be 40 paces in width by 80 in length, and within them two pavilions
are to be pitched for the use and comfort of the combatants. The herald
is to come on horseback to the gate and to cry three times; firstly,
before the arrival of the appellant; secondly, when the combatants have
entered the lists; and thirdly, when they have taken their oaths. The
appellant should be first in the field on the day of battle, before the
hour of noon; the defendant not later than four in the afternoon. The
parties make their affirmations and the sign of the cross, and appear
before the stand on which the judge is seated, and he commands them to
raise the visors of their helmets, after which they return to their
pavilions. The herald, after having called them for the third time,
motions them to kneel before a table on which a crucifix and missal
are placed, when a priest admonishes them; and the marshal takes off
their right-hand gauntlets and hangs them on the arms of the cross. The
combatants then mount their horses, the pavilions are removed from the
lists, and the marshal cries, “Gentlemen doe your Deuoire,” throwing
down his glove, and the combat begins.</p>

<p>The body of the vanquished, dead or alive, shall be delivered by the
judge to the marshal, his points cut and armour cast piecemeal in the
lists, and his horse and armour shall appertain to the constable and
marshal of the field. The victor shall depart honourably from the
lists, on horseback.</p>

<p>Ashmole MS., No. 764, p. 7, furnishes the following:—“<i>De la droite
ordonnance du Gaige de Bataille par tout le royaume de France Philipe
par la grace de Dieu Roy de France a touz ceulx qui ces presentes
lettres verront salut.</i>” This letter of King Philip IV, written in
1306, limits the practice of wager of battle, and is prefixed to
regulations for the whole course of the combat (44-54 b).</p>

<p>In Favine’s <i>Theatre of Honour and Knighthood</i>,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
rendered into English in 1622, judicial duels are thus defined:—“It was the
custome of our auncient French to vndertake the hazard of armes and combat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
to justifie themselues in an Accusation, fordged against their honour and
good fame; and to sustaine the truth of some iust cause, whereof the
proofes were doubtfull, yea, wholly hid and concealed.” In France the
oaths were administered over the bones and relics of saints and martyrs.</p>

<p>In <i>La Vie de Bertrand Du Guesclin</i><a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
is an account of a singular legal duel between Jews, named Daniot
and Turquant, which took place in Spain; and the narration aptly
illustrates the superstitious character of the times and country. These
Jews were accused of assassinating Blanche de Bourbon at night in her
bed; and on being charged with the crime Daniot averred that he had not
entered the bed-chamber of the princess at all, and had done his best
to prevent Turquant from committing the murder. This Turquant denied
on oath, stating that his accomplice had taken an equal part with
himself in causing the death of the princess. On hearing of this direct
conflict of testimony Bertrand Du Guesclin is stated to have suggested
a judicial duel in the lists (<i>champ-clos</i>) between the parties, and
this having been assented to the fight duly took place. The combatants,
who were well mounted and in complete armour, fought with swords,
and after some severe passages Turquant wounded Daniot in the arm so
severely that he was incapacitated from further combat, owing mainly
to the loss of so much blood. The <i>coup de mort</i> was about to be given
to the vanquished champion and a confession of his guilt demanded when
just at that moment a thick cloud appeared above the heads of the
combatants, and issuing from it a flash of lightning struck them both dead.</p>

<p>Among the Monstrelet illustrations is a picture of a highly improbable
judicial duel between a man and a dog, the man being accused of
murdering the dog’s master. The picture was copied from an ancient
painting which hung in the great hall of the Castle of Montargis, and
is supposed to picture an event recorded by Colombière in <i>Theatre
d’Honneur et de Chevalerie</i>. The fight is stated to have taken
place in the reign of Charles V of France (1364-1380).<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
The scene represents the duel in progress within a large circular
enclosure or lists, around which are galleries and promenades like
a theatre, the numerous spectators being richly dressed nobles and
ladies. Companies of soldiers are on guard and there is a large band
of trumpeters. The defendant is clad in a leather jerkin, torn in
places, and slashed drawers; he is armed with a baston or club and a
large circular shield. The dog, a large staghound, is seen gripping the
murderer by the throat, and justice is vindicated.

<p>“On the seuenth of June 1380 a combat was fought afore the kings
palace at Westminster, on the pauement there, betwixt one sir John
Anneslie knight, and one Thomas Katrington esquire; the occasion of
which strange and notable triall rose hereof. The knight accused the
esquire of treason, for that which the fortresse of saint Sauior within
the Ile of Constantine in Normandie, belonging sometime to sir John
Chandois, had béene committed to the said Katrington, as capteine
thereof, to keepe it against the enemies, he had for monie sold and
deliuered it ouer to the Frenchmen, when he was suffientlie prouided
with men, munition and vittels, to have defended it against them: and
sith the inheritance of that fortresse and landes belonging thereto,
had apperteined to the said Annerslie in right of his wife, as néerest
cousine by affiniti vnto sir John Chandois, if by the false conueiance
of the said Katrington, it had not beene made awaie, and alienated
into the enemies hands: he offered therefore to trie the quarrell by
combat, against the said Katrington, wherevpon was the same Katrington
apprehended, and put in prison, but shortlie after set at libertie
againe.” It was decided to try the case by combat, and the constable
and marshal were duly notified. Lists were erected and crowds assembled
on the day appointed to witness the fight. On being called three times
by the herald-at-arms the parties entered the lists for fighting, and
the articles of combat were publicly read, and after each had been duly
sworn the fight commenced “first with speares, after with swords, and
lastlie with daggers. They fought long till finallie the knight had
bereft the esquire of all his weapons, and at length the esquire was
manfull overthrowned by the knight,” who was declared the conqueror.
The esquire died soon after from his hurts. The king was present at the
fight.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hewitt<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
describes a legal duel of the reign of King Richard II, between a
chevalier of Navarre and an English esquire, which is figured in Cotton
MS., Nero, D VI. The engraving has been reproduced in Strutt’s
<i>Regal Antiquities</i>.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
Holinshed gives an account of the duel, as taking place in 1384,
between John Walsh or Wallis and an esquire of Navarre named Martilet;
the charge being that the former had forced the wife of the latter.
Martilet was slain, his body drawn, hanged and beheaded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Froissart describes a judicial duel which took place at Paris in the
year 1386, in the reign of Charles VI of France, between the Chevaliers
Jean de Carouge and Jacques le Gris, both knights of the household
of the Comte d’Alençon. Owing to the singular nature of the charge
the event caused a great stir at the time and drew a multitude of
spectators from far and near. De Carouge leaving France to take part
in the crusade in Palestine, his young and handsome wife, a modest and
virtuous dame, awaited his return in their strong castle of Argenteil.
Jacques le Gris having conceived an unlawful passion for the lady
determined to gratify it during the absence of her lord. He paid a
visit to the castle one morning and was received by the lady with all
honour as being a companion at arms of her husband; and was being shown
over it when he asked to see the dungeon. She suspecting no evil, took
him down to it alone, when he suddenly locked the door, took advantage
of her and forced her. On the return of de Carouge from the Holy Land
his wife complained to him of the outrage, which was solemnly denied by
the defendant; and the husband called together his friends and kindred
to advise with them as to his proper course of action. Parliament was
applied to, and a combat to the death between the parties was arranged
to take place, de Carouge to act as champion for his wife, le Gris
to defend his honour in his own person. Lists were erected at Paris
behind the Temple, together with accommodation for the vast number of
spectators expected to be present. King Charles was at Sluys at the
time superintending the arrangements for a contemplated invasion of
England, but he hurried back to Paris to sit as umpire on the occasion.
On the day of battle the two knights entered the lists, with their
sponsors, armed at all points; and the onset was sounded for a joust
<i>à outrance</i>, which was run without hurt to either party. They then
dismounted and attacked each other with swords. De Carouge was first
wounded in the thigh, but continued fighting and at length passed his
sword through the body of his adversary, killing him instantly. The
body of le Gris was delivered over to the common hangman by the marshal
and dragged to Montfauçon, where it was gibbeted.</p>

<p>Juvenal des Ursins, in <i>Histoire de Charles VI</i>,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
also gives an account of this duel, which differs materially from that of
Froissart, and is more likely to be correct. It states that when the vanquished
knight lay wounded on the ground and when de Carouge was about to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
administer the <i>coup de grâce</i> he demanded a confession of guilt, but
le Gris with his last breath solemnly asseverated his denial of the
crime; and innocent he was later proved to be, for some time afterwards
another person on his death-bed confessed to having committed the
outrage. The motive of the lady in charging the wrong person is not
apparent. The duel is also described in <i>Les Annales de France</i>.</p>

<p>In 1398 the Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk accused each other of
treason, and a duel took place between them, though King Richard had
in vain tried to reconcile them. Holinshed gives the following account
of this combat:—“The duke of Aumarle was that daie high constable
and the duke of Surrie marshal, and they entered vnto the lists with
a great companie of men apparelled in silke sendall, imbrodered with
siluer both richlie and curouslie, euerie man hauing a tipped staffe
to keepe the feeld in order. About the houre of prime came to the
barriers of the listes, the duke of Hereford, mounted on a white
courser, barded with gréene and blew veluet imbrodered sumptuouslie
with swans and antelops of goldsmiths worke, armed at all points. The
constable and marshall came to the barrier, demanding of him what he
was, he answered ‘I am Henrie of Lancaster, duke of Hereford which am
come hither to doo endeuer against Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke, as
a traitor vnto God, the king, his realme, and me.’ Then he entered the
listes, and descended from his horse, and set him down in a chaire of
greene veluet, at the one end of the lists, and there reposed himself,
abiding the comming of his aduesarie.” King Richard then entered the
lists with great pomp “accompanied with all the péeres of the realm,”
and took his seat upon the tribune. “After him entered the Duke of
Norfolk, his horse barded in crimcon velvet, embroidered with lions in
silver and mulberry trees,” and he took his seat in a chair, “which was
of crimosen veluet, courtined about with white and red damaske.” The
herald then gave the signal for the combat to begin, but the course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
proved abortive, and the king cast his bâton, the heralds crying “Ho,
Ho.” A council was then held by the king resulting in both dukes being
banished the realm.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<h3>TRIAL BY COMBAT IN GERMANY<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor"><small>[261]</small></a></h3>

<p>Application had to be made by an appellant to the civic authority of a
town before a judicial duel could take place, and this having been done
the following answer would be given:—</p>

<p>“We have received your letter and are very sorry to see that your
hearts are so moved with rancour and hatred as you seem to bear to
one another. In which regard we pray you that you would desist from
combat if it may be; and that you would end your quarrels by the way of
mildness and gentleness without the adventuring of handy strokes and
without shedding human blood. Consent to our request, and so much the
rather because we entreat you most instantly.”</p>

<p>Should the demand for a trial by combat be still persisted in the
following answer was returned:—</p>

<p>“Seeing that you still persist in your hatred and challenge, and that
the way of gentleness can take no course of kindness between you, we
do order and appoint that you shall appear on such a day before us to hear
the ground and subject of your quarrel, wherein we mean to do you justice.”</p>

<p>A day may then be assigned for the combat if it be allowed.</p>

<p>The preliminaries and regulations are similar to those which prevailed
in France and England, with, however, the difference that in each
of the pavilions pitched in the lists for the accommodation of the
combatants, a bier, a coffin, four candles and a shroud for the dead
were placed; and both the appellant and defendant were confessed by a
priest. If not slain the party vanquished remained infamous for the
rest of his life; he was never allowed participation in aught knightly,
and his beard was to be kept close-shaven.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Trials by combat in Germany were more complex and far-reaching than was
the case in France and England, and the weapons employed in conducting
them more varied and specialized in character.</p>

<p>A paper was read on February 20th, 1840, before the Society of
Antiquaries, London, by Mr. R. L. Pearsall,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
entitled, “Some Observations on Judicial Duels, as practised in Germany”; a
short résumé of which follows here. The paper is largely based upon a curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
manuscript of the year 1400, in the Royal Library at Munich, containing some
text and a number of wood-cuts on vellum, representing various forms of
duel in Germany. The work is by Paulus Kall “Master of Defence”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
to the then Duke of Bavaria; and the illustrations refer to judicial and
perhaps other duels as practised in the Fatherland about the end of the
fourteenth century, as well as to some others of a still earlier period.
This MS., together with others at Munich and Gotha, references to which
Mr. Pearsall has omitted to give, form the ground-work of his paper.</p>

<p>Strange though it may seem, the legal duel was resorted to as a court
of appeal in extreme cases of quarrels and accusations between man
and wife; and Fig. 2 in Paulus Kall’s book affords an illustration of
the manner in which such combats were conducted. It depicts a man,
bare-headed, buried in a pit up to his loins, holding a short staff
in his right hand, the left arm bound to his side. The woman is clad
in her chemise only, which is bound together below the middle by a
lace passing between the legs; the right sleeve of the garment extends
beyond the hand “<i>ein dunne Elle</i>” in a bag which contains a stone,
and this constitutes her weapon of attack. At first sight the combat
would appear to be an unequal one. It might be thought for a moment
that the wood-cut had been conceived in a humorous sense, but there is
no doubt whatever that such duels did really take place in Germany,
though cases of the kind were probably comparatively rare after the
twelfth century; and, indeed, Mr. Pearsall had not been able to find
any record of an actual combat of the kind later than the year 1200,
when a man and his wife are stated to have fought under the sanction
of the civic authorities at Bâle. We may take it, however, from other
evidence that the practice continued up to the close of the fourteenth
century and perhaps even later. Reference is made in the paper to a
book of drawings, also at Munich, executed as late as the end of the
fifteenth century, among which is a representation of such a duel,
though possibly traditional in character. The man here is depicted as
buried up to the waist in a tub; he wears a skull-cap, and is armed in
the same manner as shown in the other drawing, with a short staff, the
left arm tied to his side. The woman is fully dressed and in the act of
swinging a weapon which looks like a sling, in which is a stone. Mr.
Pearsall further refers to “an ancient codex of defence” in the library
at Gotha, one of the drawings depicting a duel between a man and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
wife, the former fighting from a tub; and the man is shown to have
vanquished the woman and drawn her into the tub headforemost, in which
she appears with her legs kicking in the air. This incident explains
why the chemise, as shown on Fig. 2 of Kall’s work, was tied with a
lace between the legs; and that wood-cut also illustrates the mode of
action on the part of the duelists in attack and defence. The woman’s
weapon is thus seen not to be a sling at all, but one similar in
principle to the extended sleeve with a bag at the end in which is a
stone; the object being to inflict a swinging blow on her opponent, who
parries with his staff. Another cut, the source of which Mr. Pearsall
does not mention, represents a more deadly form of duel between a man
and a woman, who fight bare-headed and naked to the girdle, with small
falchions, like knives; and wounds are shown on both their persons.</p>

<p>A singular form of duel, pictured in Paulus Kall’s book, is that with
“<i>shilts</i>,” used as weapons both of attack and defence, sometimes
alone, and at others in conjunction with daggers held in the disengaged
hand. To judge from the wood-cuts this great oblong shield is about 4½
feet long by about 18 inches broad; and though the examples depicted
differ somewhat, they are all garnished at the head, foot, and sides
with a greater or less number of projecting spears or spurs, for
the purposes of attack. The combatants are wearing greyish-brown
tight-fitting dresses and hoods; the faces, hands and legs are left
bare. The preliminaries completed, the duelists are conducted into the
lists by an official; each combatant brings a bier and is accompanied
by his relations and a confessor. The principals are then sworn, their
weapons handed to them, and the onset sounded. It would appear from the
surrounding details and the character of the officials concerned, that
this form of duel appertained to members of the privileged class.</p>

<p>A fourth kind of duel was fought with spiked clubs (or more usually
with swords) and “<i>der Hutt</i>,” a shield formed like a hat; and Kall’s
wood-cut pictures the duelists as being clad in garments of cloth.
The shields vary in size from very small to very large, the latter
kind being employed in conjunction with spiked clubs, the former with
swords. Another form of duel is with the “<i>streit-axt</i>” (<i>bec de
faucon</i>), the variety of battle-axe with a hammer on one side of the
head and a spike, like that of a pick, on the other. Here the champions
fight in complete armour; and besides axes they carry swords and
daggers. In the Gotha codex is a drawing entitled, “<i>Dass ist wie sich
ainer versorgen sol der zu gewapenter Hand fechten sol</i>,” meaning that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
this is the equipment for a duel with gauntlets. The duelist is shown
as being anointed with oil by his armourer preparatory to combat; and
the items of his body-armour stand ready to be put on in their turn.
Some of the wood-cuts in Paulus Kall’s work afford representations of
such duels; and the text furnishes directions as to how they were to be
conducted. It was from this kind of legal duel, more especially, that
combats on foot in the lists at a <i>pas d’armes</i> had their origin.</p>

<p>The last form of duel referred to in Mr. Pearsall’s paper is one with
two-handed swords; and a wood-cut of Paulus Kall’s illustrates a combat
of the kind, in which the duelists are clad in jerkins and long hose.
The swords appear to measure about five feet in length. These clumsy
and unwieldy weapons were for striking and parrying, but could not be
employed effectively at close quarters.</p>

<p>An original manuscript in the possession of Mr. Richard Bull, <span class="smcap">f.s.a.</span>,
at the commencement of the nineteenth century, contains the orders,
rules and regulations issued by Thomas Duke of Gloucester, the
Constable of England, in the reign of King Richard II, 1377-99, for
observance in cases of trial by combat.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
They differ little from those of an earlier period, but the particulars
given of the lists may be noted with advantage. They run:—</p>

<p class="blockquot">“The Kinge shall finde the feeld to fight in
and the listes shalbe made and deuised by the Constable and it is to
be considered that the listes must be 60 pace longe and equally made
without greate stones the grounde flat and 40 paces brode in good order
and that the grounde be harde stable and firme and that the lists be
strongly barred abowt with one dore in the este an other in the weste
with good and stronge barres seven foote highe or more than a horse can
leape over them.”</p>

<p>The weapons were to be “glayues,”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
long sword, short sword and dagger.</p>

<p>There are other copies of these rules extant besides the one given in
the <i>Antiquarian Repertory</i>, viz., Ashmole MS. 856, 83-89, and that
among a MS. Collection of Ordinances of Chivalry of the fifteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
century, belonging to Lord Hastings. The last-named document is
copied in Lord Dillon’s paper on these Hastings MS.,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
published in <i>Archæologia</i>, Vol. LVII, and is reproduced in our
<a href="#APPENDIX_H">Appendix H</a>, but with the long preamble left out. These three
copies of the rules for conducting judicial duels in the reign of Richard II vary
somewhat; for instance, glaives<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
are mentioned in the two first copies as being among the weapons employed
in these combats, but not in the last.</p>

<p>A case lodged by an appellant should be pleaded in the court before the
constable and marshal, and if the accusation cannot be substantiated by
witnesses, a recourse to trial by combat may be granted by the Crown.
Should a judicial duel be decided on, the time and place of combat are
fixed by the constable; the weapons to be “glayves,” long-swords, short
swords and daggers. Sureties to be found by both parties to keep their
day, and no attempt shall be made to injure the plaintiff or defendant
before the day of battle.</p>

<p>The general rules and arrangements do not differ materially from
those of earlier reigns, though here it is mentioned that spears of
equal length were issued to the combatants, thus explaining the term
“glayves.”</p>

<p>If the charge be one of treason the vanquished shall be stripped of his
armour, and a piece of the railings of the lists broken down, and he
shall be drawn through the lists by horses to the place of execution.</p>

<p>A judicial combat took place at Quesnoy in 1405, Duke William, Count
of Hainult, sitting as judge. The parties were two gentlemen, Bournecte
the appellant and Bounaige the defendant. The accusation was that of
murder. Lists were erected at the expense of the Duke, and the fight
commenced by each combatant hurling his lance at the other, but without
effect; they then drew their swords, and Bournecte soon overcame his
adversary, who confessed his crime, and was ordered by the judge to be
beheaded. This was a duel between members of the privileged class.</p>

<p>A trial by combat took place at Arras in the year 1431, the Duke of
Burgundy sitting as judge. The charge was one of treason, and about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
time of the duel many allegiances were being transferred from
Burgundy to France. The appellant, Maillotin de Bours, had charged
the defendant, Hector de Flavy, with having expressed the intention
of deserting the Burgundian interest in favour of that of France and
with other contemplated acts of treason. On this information the Duke
had de Flavy arrested and lodged in prison. The defendant, however,
had many influential friends at Court, and through their good offices
and representations he was at length received in audience by his
sovereign, when he solemnly denied the charge, alleging that it was
de Bours himself who had suggested the treason. The Duke then sent
for the appellant, and the discussion between the parties waxed very
violent until at length de Bours flung down his glove and demanded a
trial by combat, God showing the right. The defendant, with the Duke’s
permission, took up the glove and a day was fixed for the combat to
take place, both parties giving security to keep their tryst. Lists
were prepared and erected. Within them was the model of a sepulchre,
for de Flavy had been dubbed a knight before the Holy Sepulchre at
Jerusalem. On the day of combat the Duke took his seat on the tribune
prepared for him. De Maillotin first entered the lists armed at all
points, attended by the Seigneur de Charny and other sponsors. He
held a lance in one hand and one of his two swords in the other, and
after making his obeisance to the Duke he retired to his pavilion. Sir
Hector de Flavy entered the lists in like manner; he was influentially
attended, and his charger was led in by the two sons of the Comte de
St. Pol. After saluting the Duke he also retired to his pavilion. Both
knights on re-entering the lists were led before the judge and swore
on the Evangelists that their cause was just and true. They then took
up their positions for combat and the onset was sounded, the fight
beginning by each hurling his lance at the other, but without hurt
to either. They then attacked with swords, each champion displaying
the utmost courage and dexterity. The Duke at this juncture quite
unexpectedly cast his bâton, thus putting an end to the fight. He
commanded the attendance of the combatants to dine at his table on the
morrow, when he reconciled them to each other.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>“In the foure and twentith yeare” of the reign of King Henry VI (1446)

<p>“In the same year also, a certeine armourer was appeached of treason by
a seruant of his owne. For proofe whereof a day was giun them to fight
in Smithfield, insomuch that in conflict the said armourer was ouercome

when he should come to the field fresh and fasting, his neighbours
came to him, and gaue him wine and strong drinke in such excessiue
sort, that he was therewith distempered, and reeled as he went, and so
was slaine without guilt. As for the false seruant, he liued not long
vnpunished; for being conuict of felonie in court of assise, he was
judged to be hanged, and so he was, at Tilburne.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>A good example of a judicial duel, fought in the year 1455, is given
in <i>Histoire des Ducs De Bourgogne</i>.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
It took place at Valenciennes, a town then belonging to the county of
Hainault, which, with so many other rich manufacturing territories had
fallen under the dominion of the dukes of Burgundy, by marriage or
conquest. The privilege of sanctuary had been conferred on the town by
its ancient counts, and the old rights and charters had been confirmed
by the dukes their successors. A person named Mahiot Coquel, a tailor
of Tournay, had murdered a man in that town, and he took refuge from
justice in Valenciennes, claiming the right of sanctuary. Soon after
his arrival a near relative of the murdered man named Jacotin Plouvier,
met him in a street of the town and threatened vengeance against
him for the murder of his kinsman; upon which Coquel applied to the
magistracy, demanding their aid and counsel. The syndic then sent for
Plouvier and reproached him with having the intention of violating
the franchise of his town; but he denied this and claimed the right
of lawful combat as against Coquel, at the same time throwing down a
gage of battle. This, after some hesitation, Coquel lifted up; and a
combat was allowed as being the law of the land, without being any
infringement of the principle of sanctuary, which only applied to
protection from the officers of justice. The parties were lodged in
prison in separate cells, and seconds were appointed to arrange the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
preliminaries for the fight; when the Comte de Charolais, afterwards
Charles the Bold, on being informed of the case, acting in the capacity
of lieutenant-general for his father Duke Philippe le Bon, of Burgundy,
ordered the matter to be referred to his council for judgment. The
town authorities then applied to the Duke their sovereign lord for the
maintenance of their ancient rights, when all opposition to the combat
was withdrawn; the Duke announcing his intention of being present,
with his son the Comte de Charolais, to view the fight. Lists were
erected, not in the form usual for the tourney, but round and with only
a single entrance. The judges of the fight were the provosts of the
town of Valenciennes and of the county of Hainault, the Duke and his
son being merely spectators. Two seats draped with black cloth were
placed facing each other in the middle of the lists, and the combatants
were conducted to them and sworn on the Evangelists. The two champions
were clad in leathern garments, close-fitting and laced down the
middles, the arms and legs bare. These corselets were well greased so
that neither of the parties could easily grip the other. Their hands
were rubbed with ashes for the better grasping of their weapons, and
each held a piece of sugar in his mouth as a preventive against their
throats becoming parched with the heat. Their weapons were knotted
clubs, equal in weight and length and obtusely pointed at the narrower
ends, and triangular shields, painted red. When the signal for combat
had been given Mahiot Coquel, who was the shorter and weaker man of the
two, grasped a handful of sand with which the lists were strewn, and
threw it into the eyes of his opponent. This nearly blinded Jacotin
for the moment, and he received a heavy blow in the face from the club
of his adversary, but on recovering somewhat he set upon Mahiot and
seizing him by the arm threw him violently to the ground, then placing
his knees on his stomach, to the horror of the spectators, he kept
steadily prodding Mahiot between the eyes with the pointed end of his
club until he was dead. The body was then dragged by the hangman from
the lists to the gallows.</p>

<p>Lacroix in <i>Military an Religious Life in the Middle Ages, ＆c.</i>,
gives a picture of a judicial duel of the knightly kind, fought on foot. It
is copied from a miniature in the <i>Conquêtes de Charlemagne</i>, a MS.,
in the National Library at Paris. The combatants are armed at all
points; their weapons are swords; and the lists, of open railings, are
octagonal in form.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The general course of procedure in these matters continued much the
same up to and including the reign of Henry VIII. A manuscript of
that reign, sometime belonging to Sir Edward Wyndham, Kt., Marshal to
the Camp, gives particulars,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
The form and size of the lists and counter-lists are as before; also
the kind of weapons to be employed. The defendant, if he appear not, is
called by proclamation, made by the marshal of the king of “Heraults
of that province wherein the Battail is to be deraigned.” The bill of
challenge of the appellant and the answer of the defendant is read to
them and they take their oaths:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. That their appeal and defence is true.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. That neither hath advantage of the other in weapons.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. That each will do his best to vanquish his enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>The combatants being ready, the constable and marshal, sitting at the
king’s feet, order the onset to be sounded, pronouncing the words in
high voice, “Lesses les aller et fair leur devoir.”</p>

<p>“In the fight if either of the parties do give sign of yielding or if
the king, being present, do cry ‘Hoe,’ the constable and marshall do
part them and observe precisely who hathe advantage or disadvantage
either of the other at that instant, for if they should be awarded to
fight again, they are to be put in the same position as they were before.”</p>

<p>“If the king take up the matter they are brought honourably out of the
lists, neither having precedency over the other.”</p>

<p>If the “Battail” be performed and one party be vanquished then “in
case of Treason the rayles of the lists are broken down, and the party
vanquished is drawn at a Horse-tayl and carried presently to execution.”</p>

<p>The last instance of a duly authorised legal duel in France was
that between François de Vivonne de la Chataignerie and Guy Chabot
de Jarnac, which took place at St. Germain-en-Laye in 1547, in the
presence of the king (Henry II.) It is doubly remarkable in that it
contributed a new and subtil stroke of the sword, the “coup de Jarnac,”
and that it led to an edict being issued against duelling. This ordeal
by combat resulted in the death of de la Chataignerie.</p>

<p>Judicial Duel in 1548, 2nd Edward VI, between one Newton, a Scot, and
a gentleman named Hamilton; the former being charged with uttering
opprobrious epithets against His Majesty of England. Lists were erected
in the market-place of Haddington, and at the time appointed the
parties entered them for combat, clad in their doublets and hose, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
armed with sword, buckler and dagger. The fight began with great
spirit, Hamilton following his adversary up to the very railing of the
lists, whereupon Newton struck him on the leg with his sword inflicting
a great gash, upon which he fell to the ground and was slain. This
ending of the fight was looked upon as a miscarriage of justice.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>The Abbé de Brantôme reports a trial by combat which took place about
the middle of the sixteenth century, without the sanction of either
king or parliament. The appellant was a Seigneur de Fandilles who
charged the defendant, the Baron de Guerres of Lorraine, with an odious
crime; and it was mutually agreed that the matter be referred to the
judgment of God, in battle in the lists. The fight took place on foot
with “bastardes” (hand and a half swords) in the lists at Sedan, a
M. de Bouillon acting as judge. De Fandilles severely wounded his
adversary in the thigh with a stroke of his powerful weapon, and the
loss of blood was so great that the defendant could hardly keep his
feet, at length falling to the ground. The lists were as usual freely
strewn with sand, and the baron clutched handfuls of it which he threw
into the eyes of his opponent, who was blinded for the time being and
incapacitated from continuing the combat. This ending of the duel by
means of an action strictly forbidden by the laws of the duello caused
great disputes between the seconds and friends of both parties; and the
matter was further complicated by a fall of the stand which afforded
accommodation to the judge and spectators. This was certainly an
irregular judicial duel, without any sanction at law, though the legal
forms were observed.</p>

<p>Brantôme narrates several other duels.</p>

<p>In Harleian M.S., Vol. III, 505, 7021-22, is a catalogue of judicial
combats anciently granted by the kings of England.</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth judicial duels had become rare, and the
crown employed all its influence in their restraint. Fierce polemics
had arisen in regard to the lawfulness or otherwise of the practice,
and the conscience of the nation had been thoroughly aroused against
them by reason of cases of more than suspected miscarriage of justice
coming to light. Strong influence was brought to bear on the law courts
to place all possible obstacles in the way of granting licences for
such combats, and judges, at that time more especially, usually managed
that disputes concerning the possession of land should be settled
in the law courts without any resort to the ordeal of battle. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
treatises were written against the practice, examples of which follow:
Ashmole MSS., No. 856, p. 10. “Duello foild. The whole proceedings
in the orderly dissolveing of a designe for single fight betweene
two valient gentlemen; by occasion whereof the unlawfulnesse of a
duello is preparatorily disputed, according to the rules of honour and
right reason; written by the Lord Henry Howard Earle of Northampton.”
126-145, p. 11. “A Discourse touching the unlawfulnesse of private
combates, written by Sir Edward Cooke Lord Chiefe Justice of England,
at the request of the Lord Henry Howard Earle of Northampton.” (3 Oct.,
1609.) 146-148. “Ex MS. in Bibl’ Hatton.”</p>

<p>Cotton MS. Titus. Fol. 33. A treatise on duels, in two books. (239.)
Fol. 38. Two papers on measures taken against duels. (402.) Fol. 44. A
paper concerning laws against duels. (416.)</p>

<p>On the 18th June, 1571, a judicial duel was ordered to take place, the
principals being Simon Low and John Kime, who were to fight by proxy in
the persons of George Thome and Henry Nailer, respectively. The dispute
between the parties related to the possession of some land; and the
weapons for the intended fight were to be bastons and leathern shields.
A plot of ground, 21 yards square, in Tothill Fields, was doubly railed
in for the fight, and a stand connected with it was erected for the
chief justice, as representing the court of common pleas. Behind it two
tents were pitched for the use of the combatants. The Queen was much
against the fighting, and the combat did not come off after all, for
the champion of the appellant failed at the last moment to put in an
appearance, so the plaintiff was non-suited.</p>

<p>Duels of the privileged order naturally survived those of the
proletariat. Ashmole MS., No. 856, p. 7, gives “The manner of the
challendge made by the Earle of Northumberland against Sir Francis
Veare,” both by letter dated 24 Apr. 1602, and by inter-messages, until
forbidden by the Queen’s commandment. (107-111.) Ex. MS. in Bibl’
Hatton, and, under the same number, P. 16. “The manner of Donald Ld
Rey, and David Ramsey esq. their comeing and carriage at their tryall,
upon monday, the 28 of November, 1631, before the Ld of Lynsey, Lord
High Constable of England, and others.” This is a very full report of
the trial. (175-227.) Under No. 856, p. 15. “His MAᵗˢ: declaration
against duells, published at his chappell at Bruxells upon sonday the
24th of November 1658.” (172.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Though practically in abeyance for a long period the law for an appeal
to combat had remained on the statute book; and a trial by battle
was demanded as late as the year 1817, in the case of Thornton <i>v.</i>
Ashford. The judge, Lord Ellenborough, pronounced “that the general law
of the land is that there shall be a trial by battle in case of appeal
unless the parties bring themselves within the scope of one of the
exemptions.” The suit was allowed, but the challenge being refused no
combat ensued. The law was repealed in the following year (1818).<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>In firste the quarelis and the billis of the appellaunt and of the
defendaunt schal be pletid in the courte.before the constable and
marchall. And when they may not prove ther cause by witnesse.nor bi
non other manner but detrmine ther quarell bi strengthe.the ton for to
prove his entent up on the tother. And the tother in the same manner
for to defende him. The constable hath power for to ioyne that batayle
as vecarie genrall undir god ＆ the kynge and the bataile conioynt by
the Constable.he schal assigne them day and place.so that the day be
not within xl.dayes after the saide batell soo conioynt.but yf it be bi
the consentinge of the seyde appellaunt and defendaunt. Than he schall
awarde them.poyntes of armes.other wise callid wepenes.ayther of them
schal have.that is to say.longe swerde schorte swerde and dagger.so
that the appellant and defendaunt.fynde sufficianunt surete ＆ plegges
that echou of them schal come at his seyde day.the appellaunt for to
doo his power up on the defendaunt.and the defendaunt in his defence
up on the appellaunt. And this to be done.schall be gevyn un to the
appellaunt hour terme and soon.for to make his preve and der (sic)
and for to bethe firste within the listes. for to quite his plegges.
And of the same wise of the defendaunt. And noon of hem schall do
hevinesse.ille harme awaite assaute.nor non other grevaunce.nor ennye
bi them nor bi non of ther frendes welwillinge.nor bi non other who soo
ever it be. The kynge schal fynde the felde.for to feght in. And the
(f. 125b) listes schal be made and devisid by the constable. And it
is to be considerid that the listes schal be.lx.pases of lengthe and
xl.paces of brede in good manner.and that the erthe be ferme stable
and harde.and even made, without grete stones and that the erthe be
plat.and that the listes be strongli barred rounde aboute and a gate
in the este and a nother in the weste with good and stronge barrers
of vij.foote of heyght or more. And it is to wite that ther schulde
be faux listes withouten the principal listes betwene the whiche the
men of the constable and the marchall and s’gauntes of armes of the
kynges schulde be for to kepe and defend yf any wolde make any offence
or fray azens the cries made in the courte in any thinge that myght
be agayns the kynges Roiall mageste or lawe of armes and these men
schulde be armed at all poyntes. The Constable schal have there as
many men of armes as he will and the marchall also bi the assignacion
of the Constable and ellis not the whiche men schal have the kepynge
as is seyde. The s’gauntes of armes of the kynge schal have the keping
of gates of the listes and the arestinges yf any schal be made bi the
comaudemt of the seyde Constable and Marchall. The day of bataile the
kynge schal be in a sege or in a shaffold on heght and a place schal
be made for the Constable and marchall at the stayre foot of the seyde
shaffold there where thei schal be. And than schal be axed the plegges
of the appellaunt and defendaunt for to come in to the listes afore the
kynge and present in the courte as prisioners un to the appellaunt and
defendaunt be come in the listes and have made ther othes. When the ap
(f. 126) pellaunt cometh to his iorney he schale come to the gate of
the listes in the Este in such manner as he will feght with his armes
and wepenis assignid to him bi the courte and ther he schal abide til
he be led in bi the Constable so that when he is comen to the seyde
gate the Constable and marchall schal goo thedir. And the Constable
schal axe him what man he is whiche is comen armed to the gate of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
listes. And what name he hathe and for what cause he is comen. And the
appellaunt schal answere I am suche aman. A. de. K. the appellaunt the
whiche is come to this iorney ＆c for to doo ＆c. And than the Constable
schal open the viser of his basinet soo that he may playnli see his
visage and if it be the same man that is the appellaunt than schal he
make open the gates of the listes and schal make him entre with his
seyde armes poyntes vitailes and other leuefull necessaries up on him
and also his counsell with him and than he schal lede him afore the
kynge and than to his tente where he schal abide til the defendaunt be
comen. In the same manner schal be done of the defendaunt but that he
schal entre in at the weste gate of the listes. The Constable clerk
schal write and sette in the regestre the comyge and the houre of the
entringe of the appellaunt and how that he entreth the listes on fote
and also the harnyes of the appellaunt how that he is armed and with
how many wepenis he entreth the listes and what vitailes and other
leueful necessaries he bringeth in with him. In the same manner schal
be don to the defendaunt. Also the Constable schal mak take hede that
non other before ne behinde the appellaunt (f. 126b) nor the defendaunt
brynge more wepin nor vitailes other then were assignid bi the courte.
And yf it be soo that the defendaunt come not be time to his iorney and
at the oure and terme limit bi the courte the Constable schal comaunde
the marchall for to make calle him at the four corners of the listes
the whiche schal be done in manner as it foloweth. Oyes. Oyez. Oyez.
C. de. B. defendaunt come to yowre Jorney whiche ye have undirtake at
this day for to aquite yowre plegges before the kinge the constable
and marchall in yowre defence agayns. A. de K. appellaunt of that
that he hathe put up on yow. And yf he come not be time he schal be
callid the secunde time in the same manner and at the ende he schal say
come the day passeth faste and yf he come not at that time he schal
be callid the thridde time. But that this be betwixe hye tierce and
none. In the same manner as before and at the ende he schal say the
day passeth faste and the oure of none is nye soo that ye come bi the
seyde oure of none at farrest in pitt that may come. But how soo ever
the Constable hathe yevy oure and terme un to the defendaunt for to
come to his Jorney never the lesse yf that he tarie un to the oure of
none the Jugement schulde not bi right goo agayns him whethir it be in
cas of treson or not. But soo is it not of the appellaunt for he muste
holde the houre and time limitid bi the courte withoute any plonginge
or excusacon what soo ever be it in cause of treson. The appellaunt and
the defendaunt entrede in the (f. 127) listes with ther armoure wepenes
vitailes and leuefull necessaries and counsell as is seyde and as thei
are assigned bi the courte. The Constable schal wete the kinges wille
yf he wil assigne any of his noble lordes or knyghtes of worschipe un
to the sayde pties and yf he wil that the othes be made afore him or
afore the Constable and marchal. And the appellaunt and defendaunt
schal be serchid bi the Constable and marchall of there poyntes of
armes otherwise callid wepenis that they be vowable without any man
disseyte on them and yf thei be other than reson axeth they schal be
taken away ffor reson good feythe and lawe of arms wil not suffre
no gile nor dissayte in soo gret a dede. And it is to wite that the
appellaunt and defendaunt may be armed as sewrely upon ther bodies as
they will. And than the Constable schal sende firste after the marchall
and than for the appellaunt with his counsell for to make his othe.
The Constable schal axe him yf he wil any more protest and that he
putte forthe all his ptestacions bi writinge for fro that time forthe
he schal make no ptestacion. The constable schal have his clerke redy
in his presence that schal ley forthe a masse book open. And than the
Constable schal make his seyde clerke rede the bille of the appellaunt
enterly on heyght and the bille redde the constable schal say to the
appellaunt A. de K. thou knowest wel this bille and this warant and
wedd’ that thou gave in oure courte thou schal lay thi right honde here

Thou. A.de.K. this thi bille is sothe in all poyntes and articles fro

constable schal make the marchal calle the defendaunt and soo schal be
done to the defendaunt in the same manner as to the appellaunt. And

trustest in non other thinge but onli in god and thi body and on thi
rightful quarell so helpe the god and these halowes and the othe made
he schal be led agayne to his place. In the same wise schal be done
to the defendaunt. The whiche othes made and ther chambirleyns and
srvauntes put a way. the Constable schal make calle bi the marchall
the appellaunt and the defendaunt also the whiche schal be ledde (f.
128) and kepte bi the men of the Constable and marchall before them
and the Constable schal say to bothe the pties. Thou A.de.K. appellour
schal take. C.de.B. defendoure bi the rigt honde and he the. And we
defende yow and echone of yow in the kinges name and up on the pill

that is founden in defaute that non of yow be so hardy to doo to other
ille ne grevauce thirstinge nor other harme bi the honde up on the pill
afore sayde and this charge gevy. the Constable schal make yeve ther
right hondis to gedir and ther lifte hondes up on the missale sayinge
to the appeloure. A.de.K. appelloure thou swerest bi the feythe that
thou yevest in the honde of thine advsarie. C.de.B. defondoure and bi
all the halowe that thou toucheste with thi lifte honde that thou to-day
this day schal doo all thi trewe power and entente bi all the weyes
that thou beste may or kanste to preve thine entente on. C.de.B. thine
advsarie and defendoure to make him yelden him up to thine honde and
creant to crie or speke or ellis make him die bi thine honde to fore
that thou wende oute of these listes bi the tyme and the sunne that
the is assignid bi this courte bi thi feythe and soo helpe the god and

this day thou schall doo all thi trewe power and entente bi all the
weyes that thou beste may or kanste to defende thine entente of all
that (f. 128b) that is put on the bi. A.de.K. thin advsarie appelloure
bi the feythe and soo helpe the god and all these halowes. And than the
Constable schall comaunde the marchall for to crie at the foure corners
of the listes in manner as foloweth. Oyez. Oyez. Oyez. We charge and
comaunde bi the kynges Constable and marschall that non of gret valew
＆ of litill estate of what condicion or nacion that he be. be so hardy
hens forewarde for to come negh the listes bi foure foote nor to speke
nor to crie nor to make contenance nor token nor semblaunce nor noyse
where bi nouther of these two prties. A.de.K. appellor ＆. C.de.B.
defendour may take avauntage the ton up on the tother up on pill of
lesinge lyf and membre and ther goodes at the kinges wille. And after
the Constable and marchall schal avoyde all manner of pepill oute of
the listes except their luftenauntz and two knyghtes for the Constable
and marchall whiche schal be armed up on there bodies but they schal
have nother knyf nor swerde up on them nor non other wepenes wherbi
the appellaunt other the defendaunt may have therof any avauntage bi
negligence of kepinge of them. But the two luftenauntz of the Constable
and marchall schal have in there handes outher a spere wtoute yren
for to depte them yf the kinge will make them abide in ther feghtinge
whether it be to reste them or other thinge what som ever him liketh.
And it is to be knowen that if yf any adminstracion schulde be made to
the appellaunt or to the defendaunt of mete or of drinke or any other
necessarie thinge leeful after (f. 129) that the counsell of frendes
and s’vauntz ben put away of the appellaunt and of the defendaunt as
is seyde the seyde adminstracion apteneth to the herawdes and also
all the cries made in the seyde courte the whiche kingsz heraudes and
pursevauntes schal have a place for the assignid bi the Constable and
marchall as nye the listes as may goodli be soo that they may see all
the dede ＆ to be redy yf thei be callid for to doo any thinge. The
appellaunt in his place kepte bi som men assignid by the Constable or
marchall ＆ the defendaunt in his place in the same wise. Bothe two
made redy and arayed ＆ with feleschipe bi ther kepers above sayde the
marchall with the ton ptie ＆ the levetenant of the Constable with the
tother. The Constable sittinge in his place above sayde afore the kinge
as his viker genrall and pties made redy for the feghte as is sayde bi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the comaundement of the kinge. The constable schal say with hye voyce
as foloweth. lessiez lez aler. that is to say lat them goo and reste
a while. lessiez lez aler and reste a nother while. lessiez lez aler
＆ fair leur devoir depdieu. that is to say lat them goo and doo ther
devour in goddes name. And this seyde eche man schal depte fro bothe
pties soo that they may incountre ＆ doo that them semeth beste. The
appellaunt ne the defendaunt may nouther ete nor drinke fro that time
forthe withoute leve ＆ licence of the kinge for thinge that myght
falle but yf thei wol do it bi the consentinge betwixe them. Fro this
time forthe it is to be considered diligentli bi the constable that
yf the kinge will make the pties feghtinge depte reste or abide (f.
129b) for wham som ever cause it be that he take good kepe how thei
are deptid so that thei be in the same estate and degre in all thinges
yf the kinge wil sure or make them goo to gedir agayne and also that
he have good harkeninge and syghte un to them yf outher speke to other
be it of yeldinge or other wise for un to him longeth the witnesse and
the recorde of the wordes fro that time forthe ＆ to non other. And
yf the seyde batell of treson he that is convicte ＆ discomfit schal
be disarmed in the listes bi the comaundement of the Constable and a
corner of the listes broken in the reprove of him bi the whiche schal
be drawen oute with hors fro the same place there he is soo disarmed
thorow the listis un to the place of iustice where he schal be hedid
or hongid after the usage of the cuntre the whiche thinge apenteth to
the marchall and to ovrsee and to pforme his seyde office and to put
him in execucion and to goo or ride and to be alwey bi him til it be
done and all pformed and aswel of the appellaunt as of the defendaunt
for good feythe and right and lawe of armes will that the appellaunt
renne in the same peyne that the defendaunt schulde doo if he were
covicte and discomfit. And yf it happen soo that the kinge wolde take
the quarell in his hande and make them acordid withoute more feghtinge.
Than the Constable takinge the ton ptie and the marchall the tother and
lede them afore the kinge and he schewinge them his wille the seedy
Constable and marchall schal lede them to the on ptie of the listes
with all there pointz and armor as thei are founden and havyge when the
(f. 130) kynge took the quarell in his honde as is seyde. And soo they
schal be led oute of the gate of the listes evenly so that the ton goo
not afore the tother bi no wey in noo thinge for senne the hath taken
the quarell in his hande it schulde be dishonest that outher of the
pties schulde have mor disworschipe than the tother. Wherfore it hath
ben seyde bi many aunciaunt men that hee that gooth first oute of the
listes hath the disworschipe and this is aswel in cause of treson as
in other cause what soo ever it be. The fee of the herawdes is all the
poyntes ＆ armor brokin theis pt he taketh away or leveth after that he
is entrid the listes aswel of the appellaunt as of the defendaunt and
all the poyntes and armor of him that is discomfit be it the appellaunt
other the defendaunt. The fee of the marchall is the listes the Barrers
and the postes of them.</p>

Ailettes first appear in the second half of the thirteenth century
and continued in fashion for about sixty years. They assume various
forms, and were worn upright at the outsides of the shoulders, attached
by laces. On brasses they appear at the backs of the shoulders, but
this is probably for the reason that the artists found some practical
difficulty in picturing them so as to appear as they were really worn.
It is not clear whether these singular pieces were intended for defence
or to be used as planes for the ensignment of heraldic devices; it is
certain, however, that they could afford but little protection against
a stroke from a sword or a battle-axe.</p></div>

Aiguillettes, or laces, later termed arming points, played an important
part in the arming of a man, and were freely employed in fastening
certain parts of his armour together. These points were also an
important item in civil dress, and were usually of cord, silk, or
leather.</p></div>

Edward, the King’s son; Edmund, the King’s brother; William de Valance,
Earl of Pembroke; Gilbert de Clare; and the Earl of Lincoln. These
five noblemen constituted a court of honour, a committee in fact for
the control of the tourney. William de Valence died in 1296, so the
document must date before that year.</p></div>

The glaive here mentioned is not the weapon usually known by that name,
but the lance: for it will be observed in some later rules given on
these pages that “spears of equal length” were to be issued to the
combatants. Lances were often termed glaives at this period, and in
such combats were shortened to five feet.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
